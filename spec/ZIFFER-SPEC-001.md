# Door A: Structured-Input Security Pipeline

## Technical Architecture Specification

**Document ID:** ZIFFER-SPEC-001
**Version:** 1.3.31
**Status:** Draft — all closable items closed. Remaining open: A-7 (conceded unprovable) and independent confirmation (§14 suite 11, structurally unavailable to the authoring parties); hybrid post-quantum signature suites (CR-1..CR-7) per ANSSI hybridation doctrine; deferred release (DR-1..DR-13) with reversibility-keyed confirmation (RV-1..RV-4), mitigating the A-8 presentation residual; all prior findings dispositioned; DS-6f/AT-8b/DR-*/PB-6/PB-7/EL-2 unconfirmed
**Date:** August 2026
**Supersedes:** v1.3.22, v1.3.21, v1.3.19, v1.3.18, v1.3.17, v1.3.15, v1.3.13, v1.3.12, v1.3.11, v1.3.10, v1.3.4, v1.3.3, v1.3.2, v1.3.1, v1.3.0, v1.2.0 (2026-08)

> **Why 1.3.15 and not 1.3.14.** There is no specification v1.3.14 and there never will be. The *package* release v1.3.14 shipped with this document unchanged at v1.3.13 and says so in `RELEASE.md`; minting a specification v1.3.14 now would put two different artifacts behind one version string, which is precisely the X5 collision this document added a release-integrity rule to prevent. The number is skipped deliberately, and this note exists so that a reader who notices the gap does not go looking for a missing revision.
>
> **Why 1.3.17 and not 1.3.16.** There is no specification v1.3.16 either, and for the same reason as v1.3.14 above: the *package* release v1.3.16 shipped this document unchanged at v1.3.15. Skipping the number keeps one version string mapped to one artifact (X5). A reader who notices two gaps in the sequence is looking at the rule working, not at missing revisions.
>
> **Why 1.3.21 and not 1.3.20.** The *package* release v1.3.20 shipped this document at v1.3.18, so a specification v1.3.20 would put two different artifacts behind one version string (X5), third instance. Same rule, same deliberate gap.
**Intended Audience:** Security architects, platform engineers, policy engine implementers, formal-methods practitioners

## 1. Status of This Document

> **Editorial (2026-09-09, ACP-70). This document's id is `ZIFFER-SPEC-001`; it was `ACP-SPEC-001`.** The former id names the package releases published under it, through v1.3.19, and nothing later; the companion deployment specification is `ZIFFER-DEPLOY-001` on the same terms. Nothing normative moved — no clause is added, removed or reworded — and no identifier in any implementation changes: clause ids, crate names, module names and CLI names are what they were, so a citation of `AT-8b` or an import of `acp_executor` reads the same before and after. **The version is deliberately not bumped, and that is a disclosed edge of X5 rather than a claim to be outside it.** X5 maps one version string to one artifact, and v1.3.31 now has two renderings differing in this id and in the file name that carries it. A bump would be worse: it would mint a revision in which no rule moved, so a reader diffing two revisions to find the change would find a rename. The rendering under the former id is the one the public releases carry, and those are frozen.
>
> **⚠ CORRECTION (v1.3.31). The Attestation Object's `alg` was a field this document required, both implementations read, and no schema declared.** CR-5 makes `alg` an AT-1 field and therefore signature-covered; v1.3.8 went further and recorded the schema consequence in as many words, because AT-8b makes adding a field to this object a breaking change and the field therefore had to be introduced "in this revision, before deployment". It never reached a field set. `spec/schemas/wire/attestation_object.schema.json` listed ten properties and no `alg`, and **AT-1's own enumeration listed the same ten** — so the only clauses that carried the field were CR-5 and, from v1.3.30, HM-3. Both implementations carried it: `reference/src/acp_executor.py` and `crates/acp-decision/src/quorum.rs` each list it in their own `AT1_FIELDS`, and the Rust verifier re-parses it to choose the suite. Because AT-8b closes the set in BOTH directions, the disagreement was total rather than cosmetic: an object built from the schema was refused by both verifiers for a missing AT-1 field, and an object either verifier accepted carried a property the schema called additional. **No differential could see it** — the two implementations agreed with each other and disagreed with the document, which is the same blindness §1's v1.3.28 alert records one field over (ACP-167) and the eighth lesson in `dossier/05-TEST-EVIDENCE.md`. AT-1 and the schema now both name it. Its declared domain is the union of the two vocabularies a verifier COMPARES it against — CR-4's registered suites and HM-4's two WebAuthn key types — and it is a union rather than a single list because a third enumeration would be a copy on one side of both comparisons, and because CR-8 forbids the cheaper fix of admitting the WebAuthn names as bundle, receipt or door suites. The check that would have caught it ships with the correction and is in the gate's fast tier: `tools/check-attestation-object.py` asserts the schema, the reference and `acp-decision` declare one field set, and validates every Attestation Object this repository's builders produce against the schema, with each surviving divergence pinned to a reason. That is ACP-52's open item — nothing validates a fixture against these schemas — narrowed to the one object whose field set AT-8b makes a security property; it stays open for every other object. The narrowed check found a second disagreement on its first run and it is reported rather than resolved: the simulation builds floor-HIGH objects with `required_roles: []` for every action whose rule names no role, while the schema declares `minItems: 1`. AT-1 requires the field and states no lower bound, so which side is wrong is a decision this correction does not make. Found by writing HM-3, which says `obj.alg` MUST equal the registry entry's `alg`, and then looking for the property it names (ACP-299).
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.30). No human could approve anything this document describes, and three numbers it calls policy lived in nobody's bundle.** The attester registry demanded an Ed25519 key **and** an ML-DSA-65 key per approver, and no passkey, platform authenticator or hardware security key in existence produces an ML-DSA-65 signature — so the only human an implementation could enrol was a JSON key file on a laptop, which AT-10 rates AS0 and this document's own Art. 14(5) reading calls not a person. **§8.6c (HM-1..HM-7)** admits a human as a WebAuthn credential (`kind: webauthn`): the approver enrols a passkey or hardware key once, with user verification required and the assurance level derived from the authenticator rather than claimed; what a human signs is the same bytes a machine signs, carried as the WebAuthn challenge; the verifier checks type, challenge, origin against the entry's signed `rp_id`, `rpIdHash`, the UP and UV flags, the signature and a strictly increasing counter, in that order. **CR-8** states the cost plainly: a human leg is classical, and the post-quantum binding of a human's decision is the receipt (AB-1 digests the assertion into the body RK-5's hybrid key signs) and the anchor — never the assertion. Every registry entry now carries `kind`; an untagged entry is refused. Found by simulating the first customer's onboarding and reaching the step "enrol the approvers" (ACP-288). The second half: three numbers this document calls policy lived in nobody's bundle — how long a human has to approve, how long a floor-HIGH action is held, and what fraction of reversible releases draws a confirmation. DR-1 and DR-10 have said *bundle-configured* since v1.3.7 and no member carried either value — every implementation read the hold window and the sampling rate from its own environment — and L-15 gave the attestation window a ceiling and no home, so the engine that issues attestations used the ceiling as the window and said so in its module note. **PB-13** adds `limits.json` to §8.2: three optional integers, each absent ⇒ this document's own default (3600 s, 60 s, 10 %), each out of range ⇒ an invalid bundle (`LimitOutOfBounds`), never clamped. AT-1 now sets `expires_at` from the signed window; DR-1 refuses a hold below L-28's 30 s floor at load, on both sides of the differential, where `acp-decision`'s door had recorded the floor as "deliberately not checked here" until a check landed on both sides together. No other behaviour changes: a bundle that says nothing gets the numbers it always had. Found by asking, for a customer, "how do we define the message expiry" (ACP-287).
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.29). Two refusals every Ingress Adapter makes had no clause id, and the audit record's schema refuses the values an implementation wrote in their place.** `audit_record.schema.json` bounds `clause` to the grammar `tools/clauses.py` indexes — it is the join key between a customer's chain and this document — and the product's two ingress doors recorded `9.2`, `F1.6` and `F1.1`: a section number and two flow-register rows, none of them a clause, unnoticed because nothing validates a record's field contents at the receiver (ACP-284; ACP-285 is that receiver-side check). **WE-6** gives the canonicalisation refusal its id beside the sentence that states the encoding; **DP-89** (ZIFFER-DEPLOY-001 §7) gives the unreachable Policy Engine leg its id, beside DP-58 and DP-60 which already name the two legs behind the engine; **DP-90** gives the engine's own delivery leg to the Executor its id (the product's engine cited `F3.3`, and `F4.1` for a presentation that cannot render, which is **DP-59**'s outage); the unreachable audit leg was **DP-61** all along and is cited, not re-minted. Nine constants across two doors and the engine, three new ids and two existing ones. No component's behaviour changes — the value it writes into the chain does. Both clauses are NEW and UNCONFIRMED per §14 suite 11.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.28). Both implementations disagreed with this document about what time looks like on the wire, and agreed with each other — so no differential could see it.** Seven temporal fields (`attestation_object.expires_at`, the receipt's `issued_at`/`expires_at`, `pending_release.held_at`/`receipt_expires_at`, `audit_record.occurred_at`, `anchor.anchored_at`) were RFC 3339 strings in the schemas, in AT-1 and in §9.2's rendered receipt, and POSIX numbers in both implementations — an Attestation Object that validated was refused at §9.3 step 7b(iii), an object both verifiers accepted did not validate, and no client built from this document could satisfy a floor-HIGH quorum (ACP-167, found by the first floor-HIGH fixture built from the schema rather than from the reference). The implementations moved, because only they disagreed with the document; **WE-5** now pins the one spelling an instant has, because RFC 3339 as written permits four renderings of one instant and these values are hashed. The acknowledgement's times stay numeric — its own schema declares integer epoch seconds, enforced at reference level by `acp_ack.py`'s freshness rule — and its writer emitted a float on every production path — refused now, because a float in a canonical structure is two ids for one object (AT-8a). In the same release (ACP-164): **AU-2** gains the `seq` protocol the audit record's schema had made unsatisfiable — the writer PROPOSES the next position and the receiver refuses a mismatch carrying the expected value, so the generated `AuditRecord` (which requires `seq`) and the reference (which refused it) stop contradicting each other; **AU-9**'s per-class `outcome` domain is enforced rather than stated, because a `release` whose outcome is `not_attempted` fell out of §11.3(g)'s anchor-coverage question the way an honest refusal does; and the generated wire types stop serialising absent optionals as `null`, which had one AU-1 preimage hashing over 25 keys in Rust and 9 in Python — AU-9's founding defect, reproduced one layer down by the code generator. Each ships with the check that would have caught it: `tools/check-instant-type.py` and `tools/check-audit-preimage.py`, each a shared corpus with a consumer in both languages, in the gate's fast tier.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.27). Three values every component acted on and no signed byte or clause defined: the Proposal's field set, the receipt signing key's home, and the audit record's vocabulary.** All three were found by building the first end-to-end run (M7, ACP-48) against components already built to this document. The Ingress Adapters emitted `proposal.schema.json`'s envelope; `acp-decision` and the Python reference graded a flat object and compared `tenant_id` at its top; the envelope was closed and carried no tenant, so a conformant door's Proposal refused at §9.3 step 8 in both implementations and neither could be called wrong — this document had stated no field set (the schema said so in as many words, and reported the choice as a normative act it would not make). **PR-1** now fixes the envelope — the SR-5 triple, the fidelity class, the tenant the admitting adapter's verified bundle names, and a closed payload of `task_type`, `operator`, `targets`, `params`, `cidrs`, every field required at both levels — as the one Proposal and the one hash preimage; **PR-2** says the adapter stamps `fidelity`, `schema_hash` and `tenant_id` and refuses a submission carrying them. §9.3 step 1 had read *public key from the signed bundle* since v1.3.0 while §8.2's tree named no member for it; **PB-12** adds `receipt_identity.json`, the KMS compares it against the key it holds at §9.1.1 step 4, and step 1 verifies under it and nothing else. And AU-1 had put a record inside the chain preimage whose class had no value domain, whose timestamp had no key name, and which could not say what ran; **AU-9** pins the seven classes, the four universal fields, the per-class field sets of §11.1's table and EX-2's `outcome`, with a consumer that refuses an off-class record before hashing it. Each ships with the check that would have caught it: `Proposal::from_wire` and `acp_executor.payload()` are the only readers of the envelope in either language; both bundle loaders refuse `ReceiptIdentityAbsent`; `AuditChain.append` refuses under AU-9, and the differential compares all three.
>
> **Editorial (v1.3.26). One phrase named two pairs: "the two doors".** §5.1a is headed *The two doors* and means the model's two exits — Door A, action, and Door B, text — the binary §2.4 retired as an architecture and kept as a principle. PB-11, DR-14 and the v1.3.25 alert below say *the two doors* and mean a different pair: the two channels to the human during a deferred release, the Attestation Presentation Service and the notification service, doors since v1.3.6 because DR-2 requires a human to be reached through two of them. A reader took the second for the first and asked whether the retired binary had come back. It has not. §5.1a and PB-11 each now say which pair they mean, from their own side; nothing normative moved, no identifier changed (`presentation` / `notification` are wire values), and the collision is disclosed rather than renamed, because a rename of the prose would not rename the wire. Found by the reader it confused.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.25). T-32 closes: the two doors are signed identities the bundle names, and the Executor verifies them instead of reading the notifier's description of itself.** Since v1.3.6 the Executor established DR-2's independence by comparing two labels the notification service chose (`source_path`) and reading a boolean it set (`from_canonical`) — values classified **T** in ACP-CLASS-001 since v1.3.11, RES-8 verbatim — and `notification.schema.json` had already written down the structural reason: the notification was not among CR-1's signed structures, so there were no bytes to verify. Two clauses close it. **PB-11**: the bundle carries `door_identities.json` — the Attestation Presentation Service and the notification service, each a name plus verification keys, the two distinct over the complete suite (PB-7's rule), refused at load if either is absent or they share a key. **DR-14**: the approval summary and the notification are **Rendered Summary** objects — `alg`, `role`, `proposal_hash`, `summary` — signed under the key the bundle names for their role, and the Executor verifies both signatures and both proposal hashes at the hold; `source_path` and `from_canonical` are withdrawn. Rows 24–25 move **T → B**. Row 26, `delivered`, does **not** move and is not dressed up as moving: a delivery report is the notifier's statement about itself under any signature, so it stays **T**, disclosed and bounded — it is consumed only after the notification verified under the notification identity's key, so a false report costs the attacker that key, the second of the two compromises the two-door argument already grants nobody. What a signature does not prove is stated too: that the prose is faithful to the bytes remains DR-2's structural obligation, checked at build time by suite 3 and by no signature. Found while defining the product's M4 (ACP-47) against the row the plan said would close. **PB-11 and DR-14 are NEW and UNCONFIRMED** and require independent confirmation per §14 suite 11 before they are relied upon; the executable consumers that ship with them are named in `RELEASE.md`.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.24). The v1.3.23 order of §9.1.1 was a lockout.** The tenant comparison RAD-5 introduced was numbered step 5a — *after* step 5 verifies `bundle_epoch` against the durable high-water mark **and updates it**. The mark is keyed by the tenant the body names, and the write is monotone (CL-4); so in exactly the deployment RAD-5 exists for, a repository not partitioned by tenant, a request naming tenant B while presenting tenant A's genuine bundle would raise **B's** mark to A's epoch and only then be denied — B locked out of every lower epoch by a request B never made. The comparison is now step **4a**, before the write, and the order is part of RAD-5. Found by the product implementation, which had already placed it there and proved the order by a mutant that moves it back (ACP-144). No schema, vector or reference change: the reference has no KMS, and the order is recorded as a per-implementation obligation in `spec/vectors/OBLIGATIONS.md`.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.23). Two values every component acted on and no signed byte defined: which tenant a bundle governs, and who is woken by a critical alert.** Both were found by building the KMS as a service rather than by reading, and both are the RES-8 shape — a verifier taking a security value from the party it verifies — in places the classification table had either bounded and moved on from or never listed. **(a) No bundle named its tenant.** The KMS chooses which tenant's `receipt_signing_key` signs, and through v1.3.22 its only source was `tenant_id` in the signing request body: a value the Policy Engine wrote, classified **T** in ACP-CLASS-001 and disclosed as bounded by §9.3 step 8 — which bounds the *blast radius* of a cross-tenant receipt at one Executor and does nothing about the receipt existing. A repository partitioned by tenant narrows the exposure to a deployment property the KMS cannot inspect. **RAD-5** puts `tenant_id` in `manifest.json`, inside the tree hash; §9.1.1 gains the tenant comparison (numbered 5a here, step **4a** since v1.3.24 — see the alert above); §9.3 step 8 binds the receipt's tenant to the bundle's as well as to the Proposal's; and the row moves from **T** to **B** (ACP-139). **(b) Twenty-odd sentences in this document end "with a critical alert", and none said to whom.** Every implementation therefore chose its own audience, which is a service certifying its own coverage — the **T-32** shape one component over — and DR-13(2) had already refused exactly that for the fast-path notice. **PB-10** gives alerts the identical mechanism: `alert_targets.json` in the signed bundle, keyed by an enumerated alert class, every class named or the bundle is invalid at load (ACP-134). What PB-10 does not decide — transport and acknowledgement — is stated in the clause and deferred to ZIFFER-DEPLOY-001. **RAD-5 and PB-10 are NEW and UNCONFIRMED** and require independent confirmation per §14 suite 11 before they are relied upon; the executable consumers that ship with them are named in `RELEASE.md`.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.22). A countermeasure that cited a clause defined nowhere: T-17 promised "ES-6 monitoring".** §4.1's threat table named the countermeasure for induced fail-closed attestation flooding (T-17) as *"Queue isolation (§8.6a) + ES-6 monitoring"*. `ES-6` was defined nowhere — it occurred exactly once in this document and once in the repository, that cell, and no `ES-` family exists. It is the duplicate-clause-id defect (`CL-7`, v1.3.15) inverted: one id naming two rules made "CL-7 satisfied" unfalsifiable, because an implementation could satisfy either and cite the clause honestly; one id naming zero rules made "T-17 mitigated" unfalsifiable, because nothing could satisfy or fail it. It was found by writing, not by running — ZIFFER-DEPLOY-001 §8 reached for T-17 as the threat a capacity section cites and found a promise with nothing behind it (**ACP-60**). **The promise is withdrawn, not defined.** The clause that carried the monitoring obligation all along is **AQ-3** — queue depth and arrival rate per attester **MUST** be monitored, and depth beyond a configured bound is a critical alert — two lines below the queue-isolation clauses the cell already cited, so the cell now cites it. No clause changes meaning; what changes is that the countermeasure column names a rule that exists. Nothing that ran could have caught this: the clause-id uniqueness scan reports an id defined **twice** and is blind by construction to one defined **never**. `tools/clauses.py --selfcheck` now asserts the inverse — every id cited in a normative document is defined in one, at threshold one — and it was red on this cell at introduction and went green with this correction. `ES-6` is recorded there as **retired**: citable by the corrections that record its withdrawal, never definable again, and both halves are asserted.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.18). A type used in two normative examples and defined in no clause: one attestation, two ledger slots.** §9.2's diagnostic JSON renders the attestation nonce and the receipt nonce as `b64:…`. Those were the **only two** occurrences of `b64:` in this document and **no clause said whether the prefix was part of the value**. §11.2 pins `sha256:` to the character and records the reason it had to — *an implementer who fed forward raw bytes built a different chain while following the text* — and the nonce is worse exposed than the chain hash was: `attestation_id` is SHA-256 over the canonical CBOR of the **whole** Attestation Object (AT-8a), so an issuer carrying `b64:AAAA…` and a verifier carrying `AAAA…` derive **two ids for one object** and claim **two ledger slots**. One attestation, consumed twice — **Z4** and **T-14** reopening with **no optional field involved**, so **AT-8b does not reach it**. At the verifier the mismatch is indistinguishable from a forgery.
>
> **WE-4 is NEW and pins the type**: `"b64:"` plus RFC 4648 §4 base64 **with** padding, carried, hashed and signed as that string; a stripped prefix, missing padding or the URL-safe alphabet is rejected rather than normalized. Suite 1 gains a case, because a clause with no executable consumer is the failure this document has now recorded four times. **Found by writing the first wire schema** (`spec/schemas/wire/`) rather than by reading — the same way `tools/codegen.sh` found four defects on its first pass over `spec/schemas/bundle/`. Nothing had ever had to state the type before, because nothing had ever had to *generate* from it.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.17). A fifth defect in released code: the same number, spelled differently, removed the INV-1-HIGH quorum.** §8.3.1 typed the expression language and never typed the *environment* the expressions read. The reference therefore bound a Proposal parameter with a two-way test — integer, else string — and a JSON `22.0`, which RFC 8259 says is the same number as `22`, bound as a **string**. Type mismatch ⇒ `false`, so every comparison mentioning that parameter evaluated false and the `raise_to` clause that grades sensitive-port changes HIGH stopped firing. Against this document's own reference bundle, `port: 22` graded HIGH and was held for a two-person quorum while `port: 22.0` **graded MEDIUM and executed with no attestation at all**. The Proposal is authored by the party under verification, so the spelling is adversary-chosen, and the recomputation TR-8 exists to make independent was steered by the value it was handed. **EL-2** states the environment's value domain and requires a refusal outside it. **EL-2 is NEW and UNCONFIRMED.** Note the method: 52 conformance cases, 25 mutants and a 30,000-case cross-language differential all agreed, because none of them spells a number as a float. It was found by asking what the corpus *cannot* produce and going there — and the mutant that now guards it is a **restore** mutant, not a deletion one, because there was no check to delete.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.15). Four defects in released code, and three of them were reachable *because this document did not say enough*.** The reference implementation shipped in package v1.3.14 contained a working single-key defeat of INV-1-HIGH by two routes, a suite-floor comparison that accepted an algorithm the floor did not name, and a class of irreversible action that executed with no human notified by any route. The implementation fixes are recorded in `RELEASE.md`; what follows is the normative half, without which a second implementation reproduces them and is conformant while doing so.
>
> **(a) The quorum threshold had no named source.** §9.3 step 7b(iii) required the object's "required roles/counts" to equal "the bundle rule's", but no clause named a bundle field to hold the count, and step 7b(vi) said only "quorum satisfied" without saying *satisfied against what*. The reference therefore took the threshold from `entries[0]` — the artifact under verification — and one compromised attester key, signing one object asserting that one approval sufficed, executed a floor-HIGH action. **PB-6** now puts `quorum_k` in the signed bundle, **AT-9** makes the threshold recomputed-only, and step 7b is rewritten to say which side is authoritative. Sixth recurrence of the RES-8 class (C2 → X1 → Y1 → Z3 → W1 → this) and the first *not* found in machinery a previous fix introduced: it was in the receipt-consumption path from v1.3.4 onward.
>
> **(b) Quorum counted names, not key holders.** AT-2 requires attesters "mutually distinct" and no clause said what distinguishes them. Two registry identities sharing one public key let one key holder sign twice under two names and satisfy k=2 alone. **PB-7** requires attester verification keys to be pairwise distinct over the full suite, and makes a registry violating it an invalid bundle rather than a runtime failure.
>
> **(c) CR-4 ordered suites that are not ordered.** "Ranks below" presumed a total order over suites, but a suite is a *set of primitives* (CR-1) and those sets are incomparable: `hybrid-ed25519-mldsa65` does not contain SLH-DSA, yet outranked `slhdsa128s` under every natural reading. A deployment whose signed floor named hash-based post-quantum accepted a lattice signature with the floor check reporting satisfaction — not a stronger suite accepted, a *different hardness assumption substituted*. **CR-4 is restated as containment.**
>
> **(d) The deferred-release clauses never said what happens below floor-HIGH.** DR-1 scopes the deferred path to floor-HIGH, and DR-9's acknowledgement requirement is reachable only through it. But reversibility is a property of the *action class* while risk is recomputed from the *target's tier floor*, so an action can be `IRREVERSIBLE` and `LOW` at once — and for that action every clause in §9.6 was silent. It executed with no notification, no acknowledgement, and no record that a human existed, while **RV-1's fail-safe default set a value nothing on that path read**. Mail exfiltration has exactly this shape: floor an inbox at T1, which is the natural choice because reading mail is routine, and an injected `send_email` goes out unseen. **DR-13** now requires a durable notice, addressed from the signed bundle, committed before execution — detection, not prevention, and stated as the weaker guarantee it is. **This one was not found by reading.** It was found by `reference/suites/art_harness.py` on its first run, from a fixture written in the shape of an external adversarial corpus rather than from this document's own attack list — which is the argument for building that harness, made by the harness.
>
> **PB-6, PB-7, AT-9 and DR-13 are NEW and UNCONFIRMED** and require independent confirmation per §14 suite 11 before they are relied upon. **A note on how (c) survived:** the ranking was implemented identically in two independent implementations and a differential test asserted their agreement. It agreed. Agreement between implementations is evidence about consistency and never about correctness — particularly when the second was written by reading the first. **A note on how (d) survived:** every suite in the repository was written by the party being defended, so the attack list and the clause list had the same blind spot. Mutation testing cannot find a check that was never written, and §14's differential tests compare two readings of a document that does not mention the case.
>
> **⚠ NORMATIVE ALERT (v1.3.5).** An adversarial pass over v1.3.4's own newest machinery found **two defects in the fixes themselves**: **Z3** (DS-6b's origin check was a membership test, not a pinning test — a compromised KMS moves the idempotency key and a floor-HIGH action doubles) and **Z4** (AT-8a pinned the canonicalizer but not the schema — an optional field yields two ids for one attestation, reopening T-14). Both are closed here by **DS-6f** and **AT-8b** and mechanized in Annex D Part III. Z3 is the **fourth** recurrence of the RES-8 class (C2 → X1 → Y1 → Z3), again in machinery the previous fix introduced. **DS-6f and AT-8b are NEW and UNCONFIRMED** and require independent confirmation per §14 suite 11 before they are relied upon; Part I (Y1/Y1b/Y4) remains confirmed and normative. Two conformance artifacts now ship alongside this document: **ACP-CLASS-001** (the suite-12 classification table) and **`el1_migrate.py`** (the Z1 bundle migration checker), closing two obligations v1.3.4 created without satisfying.

> **⚠ HISTORICAL ALERT (v1.3.4).** The v1.3.3 alert is retained below for history. **Status change:** an independent adversarial review (ACP-REVIEW-002) by a party with no authorship or revision history **confirmed Y1 and Y2–Y4**, independently reproduced the Annex D artifact at its published hash, and re-ran the mutation control. AT-8 / TR-10 / step 7b are therefore promoted from PROPOSED to **NORMATIVE** in this revision. That review also produced **three new results**: (a) the published `Y1_AttackBlocked` premise was too strong and has been replaced by `Y1_AttackBlocked_Generalized`; (b) **Y3 now has normative text (DS-6)** and is mechanized; (c) a **new finding Z1** — the §8.3.1 expression grammar states no precedence for `&&`/`||`, so two faithful readings of the prose disagree on 4.9% of mixed-connective expressions (10,000-case prose-derived differential run, `diff_prose.py`). Z1 is fixed by EL-1 below. Deployments **MUST** re-run conformance suite 8 with the parser vectors.
>
> **⚠ HISTORICAL ALERT (v1.3.3).** A partial-independence review (ACP-AUDIT-001, finding **Y1**) identifies a **single-component compromise of the KMS that causes an unauthorized floor-HIGH execution**, violating INV-1-HIGH as the pipeline is written in v1.3.2 and earlier. The receipt transmits attestation *ids and signatures* but not the signed Attestation Object, so the Executor cannot verify that the quorum is **bound to the executed proposal** (§9.3 step 7b as written checks signature validity, not binding). The break is the third recurrence of the RES-8 class (C2 → X1 → Y1), each in machinery a prior fix introduced.
>
> This revision carries the fix — AT-8, TR-10, and a rewritten step 7b (§8.6 / §9.3) — and a **mechanized binding model** (Annex D) proving the fix blocks the Y1 attack and that the current check accepts it. **As of v1.3.4 the fix is NORMATIVE**, following independent confirmation (ACP-REVIEW-002). Suite 11 is **partially satisfied**: the confirmation covered §§8.6, 9, 11 and the Annex D artifact, and explicitly did **not** cover §§6–7 ingress or the Annex B expression-language proof beyond the parser layer. Those surfaces remain unreviewed by a qualified party.

This revision responds to an adversarial peer review of v1.2.0 that identified five internal contradictions, four hidden assumptions, four threat-model gaps, seven formal gaps, and five unacknowledged residual risks. Annex C maps every finding to its disposition.

Three things changed structurally, and everything else follows from them:

1. **The Door A / Door B binary is retired.** What actually varied between the two "doors" was *intent fidelity*, which is a property of an ingress adapter, not a separate architecture. There is now one pipeline, one enforcement core, and a fidelity class stamped on every Proposal that policy can rule on.
2. **Resource tier is split into a signed floor and a runtime raise.** Only cryptographically read-only inputs may lower risk. This makes the headline invariant well-defined and true, rather than ambiguous and false.
3. **Every once-valid artifact is consumed against one linearizable ledger.** Receipt nonces, human attestations, and bundle epochs share a single freshness and single-use mechanism.

**This version claims less than v1.2.0 did.** Claims of universal structural injection-immunity, exactly-once execution, and constant-time evaluation have been retired — each was either false, unachievable, or contradicted elsewhere in the document. The specification is shorter and more correct for that reason. Readers comparing versions should expect deletions, not only additions.

**What v1.3.10 changes.** Every item this document could close is closed.

**CR-6 / EO-2 resolved** by differentiating the latency budget per risk class (EO-2, §8.4), not by weakening either requirement. Hybrid suites stay mandatory everywhere; the 25 ms bound is retained for the LOW/MEDIUM hot path and raised to 250 ms for floor-HIGH, where the action has already waited on a human quorum and a 60 s hold. Optimising 15 ms on a path containing minutes of deliberate human latency was a category error in the original bound.

**Three previously unattacked surfaces were attacked, and each yielded a defect** — §8.5 accumulators, §11 anchoring, and the §8.5 × §9.6 interaction. **W1:** accumulators counted Decisions, but deferred release broke the decision-equals-execution identity, so counters inflate with actions that never ran — attacker-controllable into a targeted lockout of a legitimate operator via a `deny`-effect accumulator. Closed by AC-5 (count at release). **W3:** a floor-HIGH action executes up to ten minutes before its audit record is anchored, so a compromised audit writer can erase the record of an executed action inside the gap — and detection that can be erased is not detection. Closed by AU-7 (anchor before release), at no latency cost, because DR-1's 60 s hold was already there and idle. **W2:** AU-6's ATTEST cap compounds with DR-9's acknowledgement requirement, so denying the anchoring service saturates approvers into rubber-stamping — an availability attack that becomes a safety attack with one extra step. Closed by AU-6 (suspend sampling or fail closed during outage).

**The Executor now runs against a distributed ledger under fault injection.** Previous suites exercised the Executor and the quorum ledger separately, so nothing tested a CL-6 failure landing mid-checklist. Integration now covers it: the full attack suite holds against a 5-replica ledger, minority partitions block at step 6, a partition arriving between the nonce claim and the attestation claim burns the receipt permanently — the documented liveness cost, exercised rather than asserted — and replica loss is tolerated to the quorum bound and refused past it.

**Y5's four minors are closed:** genesis specified (AU-8), canonicalization unified on validated CBOR, reconciliation trust domain stated, nonce-claim liveness tested.

**What remains open, and why it cannot be closed here.** Two items, both structural. **A-7** (honesty of tier and reversibility labels) is conceded unprovable: no mechanism decides whether a label matches the world, and RV-2/RK-5 place label changes under two-person offline control precisely because that is the only available answer. **§14 suite 11 independent confirmation** is unavailable to any party in this document's revision history; every fix from DS-6 onward — DS-6f, AT-8b, DR-*, RV-*, CR-*, CL-7, AC-5, AU-7/8 — is mechanized and tested but unconfirmed, and this document's own pattern (C2 → X1 → Y1 → Z3 → W1) predicts the next defect lives in whichever of them is newest.

**What v1.3.15 changes.** Four clauses that were exploitable *as written*, and a correction to how this document reads its own evidence.

**PB-6, PB-7, PB-8, AT-9 and DR-13 are new; CR-4 and §9.3 step 7b are revised.** The quorum threshold now has a named home in the signed bundle and a normative rule that it is recomputed and never read from an attestation; attester identity is now resolved over keys rather than names; the `SIGNATURE` file's contents are specified as a suite plus one value per primitive, verified conjunctively; the suite floor is satisfied by containment rather than by rank; and an irreversible action graded below floor-HIGH must now commit a notice, addressed from the signed bundle, before it executes. Each closes a defect that was live in released code or in this document, and in nearly every case the implementation defect was **downstream of a gap here**: a threshold comparison whose right-hand side named no field, a distinctness requirement that never said what distinguishes, an ordering over a set that has none, and a set of release clauses that scoped themselves to floor-HIGH without saying what governed the rest. See the v1.3.15 alert in §1.

PB-8 is the one that was a defect *only* here. §8.2's file listing described the bundle signature as "Ed25519 over SHA-256 of canonical bundle tree" while Part V required hybrid composition — an implementer reading the listing while building a bundle emits a classical-only signature over the highest-leverage artifact in the system, and is CR-3 non-conformant while conforming to the sentence they read. Nothing downstream can detect it, because the post-quantum leg is absent rather than wrong. It was found while writing the offline signing tool, at the moment the format stopped being a diagram and became bytes.

**A correction worth recording, and it is PB-8's own aftermath.** Fixing the prose left the schema behind. `spec/schemas/bundle/bundle.schema.json` had described this artifact as a *tree index* — a `members` array of path and digest pairs, plus a `signature` object with two fixed base64 fields named `classical` and `pq`. Neither part survives contact with what exists. §8.2's file listing contains no index file, because the covered set is established by the canonical walk rather than by a shipped list; and PB-8 specifies one value per primitive, which is a map keyed by primitive name, hex-encoded, not a fixed pair. So this document held two descriptions of one object and they disagreed — the encoding-split defect, in the normative source, introduced by the revision that fixed the same defect one paragraph away. The file is now `spec/schemas/bundle/signature.schema.json` and describes the artifact both implementations write.

It survived a full release cycle for a reason worth stating plainly: **nothing read the schemas.** Seven normative files with no consumer, no validator, and no gate line. They were found by `tools/codegen.sh`, which generates the Rust and TypeScript types from them and was the first thing ever to open them — the defect and its detector arrived in the same commit, which is the least reassuring way for either to arrive. That codegen exists does not make the schemas validated; nothing yet checks a real bundle against them, and that gap is disclosed rather than closed.

**A second correction, and it is the same shape as the first.** §11.2's **AU-1** specified the audit chain as `SHA-256(chain_hash_{n-1} ‖ canonical(record_n))`; `reference/src/acp_audit.py` has always hashed the canonical encoding of the two-key map `{prev, record}`. Different preimage, different chain from record 1 onward. The consequence is not that an implementer fails to match — it is that **AU-3a does not hold as written**. AU-3a requires every anchor to be independently verifiable by any party holding the anchor public keys; a third party implementing AU-1 literally recomputes a different head on an **honest, untampered** chain, and AU-4 classifies a head that fails to extend a previously anchored head as a *critical integrity alert*. So the normative text routed an honest verifier into this system's own critical-alert channel, with no attacker present. A second ambiguity sat inside the first: AU-1 never typed `chain_hash_{n-1}`, and the reference feeds forward the 71-character `"sha256:…"` string where `‖` invites raw bytes. **AU-1 is restated over the single canonicaliser and both types are now pinned** — see the rationale at AU-1 for why the clause moved and the code did not.

**Both corrections survived for the same reason, and it is worth naming twice.** Neither clause had an executable consumer. `audit_suite.py` passes 11 of 11 and kills 4 mutants, but every one of those cases tests the chain against **itself** — that it is consistent, that it is tamper-evident, that reconciliation catches a rewrite. Not one compared it to AU-1's formula, and `spec/vectors/CLASSIFICATION.md` recorded the audit suite as **0 of 11 vector-expressible**, so the one suite with no shared-corpus path was the one whose formula drifted. It now reads **1 of 12** — the new case is the only pure function in that suite — and the file records why it is expressible but not yet extractable. Consistency evidence is not conformance evidence. AU-1 now has a case that derives a head from the clause as written and asserts equality with the implementation's, because an edit closes this instance and only an executing check closes the class.

**A third correction: `CL-7` named two different normative rules.** §9.3.1's consumption-ledger list defined **CL-7** twice — "ledger writes are check-then-mutate" (added in v1.3.9) and "every claim operation MUST be audited" (older) — because the v1.3.9 insertion landed *above* CL-6 and took an id that was already in use two lines below it. The list read CL-5, CL-7, CL-6, CL-7. **Both meanings were already live in this document**: §1 above cites CL-7 as check-then-mutate twice, while §10's threat table cited "CL-7 auditing" meaning the other rule — so a reader resolving the id from one place got the wrong clause in the other, and a conformance claim of "CL-7 satisfied" was unfalsifiable, since an implementation could satisfy either and cite the clause honestly. **The audit rule is renumbered CL-8** and the list is reordered. The *older* rule moved, not the v1.3.9 one, because the v1.3.9 id is cited in released prose and in `RELEASE.md`, and an id already published is the one that must not move. No code was affected — `reference/src/acp_ledger.py` implements check-then-mutate and Suites 3 and 4 cover it. What was damaged is the **citation graph**, which `spec/vectors/OBLIGATIONS.md` keys per-implementation obligations to, and which cannot express "passes CL-7" while CL-7 names two rules. `tools/selftest.sh` now asserts that clause ids are unique across every family in this document, because this was found by reading and nothing in the repository could have found it by running.

**The lesson is about a claim this document makes, not only about three clauses.** §14 rests substantially on differential testing — two implementations, one corpus, disagreement as the signal. CR-4's rank table was implemented identically in both, and the differential test asserted their agreement and got it. **Agreement between implementations is evidence about consistency and never about correctness**, and it is weakest exactly where it feels strongest: when the second implementation was written by reading the first, a shared misreading is invisible by construction. §14 suite 6 (prose-derived differential) exists for this reason and is the only suite that could have caught it, because it derives its second reading from the *text* rather than from the code — and CR-4's text said "ranks", so it would have reproduced the defect faithfully. **A prose differential inherits the specification's errors. It cannot find them.** That limit is now stated in §15 rather than left for a reader to infer.

**What v1.3.17 changes.** One clause — **EL-2** — closing a fifth defect in released code. It is here rather than in the run above because it was found after v1.3.15 shipped, and because it was found by a different method.

**A fourth correction (v1.3.17), and the first of these found by RUNNING rather than reading: §8.3.1 typed the expression and left the environment untyped.** The section said numeric literals are integers and that every FieldRef must resolve to a declared field, and said nothing about what an implementation owes a Proposal that supplies a value outside that domain. The Python reference bound each parameter with a two-way test — integer, else string — and a JSON `22.0` is not an integer, so it bound as a **string**; a string never compares equal to a number, so every clause mentioning that parameter evaluated `false`, and a `raise_to` that cannot fire cannot raise. Against this document's own reference bundle, `port: 22` graded HIGH and was held for a two-person quorum while **`port: 22.0` graded MEDIUM and executed with no attestation at all** — the same number, spelled the other way, buying the removal of INV-1-HIGH. **EL-2** now states the domain and requires a refusal outside it.

**What is worth recording is that no mutation run could have found this, and one did not.** Every mutant in the reference deletes a check and requires the matching attack to succeed, so the method can ask whether a check is load-bearing and cannot ask whether a *present* check means the right thing — the limit already recorded for CR-4's rank table in (c) above. Here it was worse: there was no check at all to delete, only a two-way test with no third arm, and a conformance corpus that never spells a number as a float agreed with itself across all 52 cases. It was found by asking what inputs the corpus can never produce and going there deliberately, which is the same method that found the out-of-range integer literal in the Rust parser one slice earlier. The new mutant is therefore a **restore** mutant rather than a deletion one: it puts the two-way test back and requires the attack to succeed, which reproduces the defect's shape instead of its absence — the second such mutant in this repository, after CR-4's.

**What v1.3.9 changes.** Three claims this document had asserted but never measured are now measured, and one of them is **false as written**.

**EO-2 is exceeded under hybrid suites — open capacity finding.** §9.7 required deployments to re-measure rather than assume. Measured on a floor-HIGH receipt (one receipt signature plus three attestation signatures, real Ed25519 and real ML-DSA-65): **p99 = 40.7 ms for signature verification alone**, against EO-2's 25 ms end-to-end budget, with **13.2 kB of signatures on the wire versus 256 B classical-only — a 53× increase**. EO-2 is **not** relaxed. It is marked as an **open conflict** (§15) between two normative requirements — CR-6's hybrid floor and EO-2's latency bound — that a deployment cannot satisfy simultaneously on a pure-software verification path. *Measurement caveat, and it matters:* `dilithium-py` is a pure-Python reference implementation; a native ML-DSA (liboqs, AWS-LC) verifies roughly two orders of magnitude faster and would very likely fit. The finding is therefore **implementation-bound, not algorithm-bound** — but a deployment that assumes it away without re-measuring on its own library has assumed exactly what §9.7 forbids assuming. The 53× wire-size increase is algorithm-bound and does not go away with a faster library.

**CL-6 is now tested, and holds.** "Fail closed on partition" could not be exercised against an in-memory ledger that is linearizable by construction. A quorum-replicated ledger with fault injection now demonstrates it: minority sides refuse, majority sides continue to serve, consumption survives a heal, replica loss is tolerated to the quorum bound and refused past it, and quorum intersection is verified **exhaustively** over all 32 splits of a 5-replica set. See `partition_suite.py`.

**A ledger defect was found by that test and fixed (CL-7).** The first origin-binding implementation wrote the proposed value to each reachable replica and *then* compared results. On a partition whose members had not seen a prior binding, it mutated them before detecting the disagreement, leaving the binding permanently split: every later read saw two values and failed closed forever. **One ordinary network event produced a durable denial of service on that Proposal, with no attacker.** The defect is the same shape as the one CL-6 guards against in `claim` — mutate-then-check instead of check-then-mutate — and is fixed by two-phase binding (CL-7 below).

**Canonical CBOR is implemented and validated, closing AT-8a's implementation gap.** RFC 8949 §4.2.1 deterministic encoding with a **validating decoder** that re-encodes what it parsed and rejects any input that is not byte-identical. A permissive decoder silently normalises and reopens Z4. Eight encoding tests cover map-key ordering, non-shortest integer arguments, indefinite lengths, trailing bytes, duplicate keys, floats, and the Z4 two-encodings-one-value case.

**What v1.3.8 changes.** Signature agility and post-quantum readiness, per the French ANSSI doctrine, which insists on **hybridation** — a post-quantum algorithm combined with a well-studied classical one — rather than wholesale replacement, exempting only hash-based signatures (SLH-DSA, XMSS, LMS); the agency stops qualifying products without PQC from 2027 and states that purchasing products lacking PQC after 2030 will not be reasonable. §9.7 (NEW) specifies signature suites, makes hybrid composition **conjunctive** (CR-3), and places the accepted suite floor in the **signed bundle** (CR-4) so a compromised issuer cannot negotiate downward.

**The load-bearing decision is that hybrid means AND, not OR.** A verifier accepting a message when *either* signature validates is strictly weaker than either primitive alone — the attacker picks whichever breaks first, so adding a second algorithm under OR *reduces* security. Annex D Part V mechanizes both directions: `CR3_AND_SurvivesPQBreak` and its classical twin show the conjunction holds under a total break of one primitive; `CR3_OR_CollapsesOnSingleBreak` and `CR3_OR_IsWeakerThanEitherAlone` show the disjunction does not.

**Note on threat timing.** "Harvest now, decrypt later" is a *confidentiality* argument and does not transfer directly here, where signatures protect *authenticity*. Receipts live ≤ 120 s (L-14) and attestations ≤ 60 min (AT-1); a primitive broken in 2035 cannot forge a 2026 receipt the Consumption Ledger already consumed. The exposed surfaces are the **long-lived** ones: the offline bundle signing key, and above all the **§11 audit chain**, whose non-repudiation value is retrospective and measured in years. Deployments **SHOULD** prioritise PQC on audit anchoring and bundle signing over receipt signing, and **MAY** use SLH-DSA standalone there — hash-based, ANSSI-exempt from hybridation, and structurally aligned with a chain that is already hash-based.

**Schema consequence, and why it had to happen now.** AT-8b closes the Attestation Object schema: adding a field is a breaking change requiring a `receipt_version` increment. `alg` is therefore introduced as an AT-1 field **in this revision**, before deployment, rather than discovered as a needed extension afterwards.

**What v1.3.7 changes.** v1.3.6's deferred release let silence stand in for approval on every action class. That is a control whose default outcome equals its approved outcome — it teaches its own users to ignore it, and decays into a log entry while the dashboard continues to report that human oversight exists. v1.3.7 keys the release mode on a new **signed** bundle property, `reversibility.json` (RV-1, absent ⇒ IRREVERSIBLE, mirroring RK-1's absent ⇒ T3): irreversible actions require positive acknowledgement from a non-operator party (DR-9), a sampled fraction of reversible ones inherit that duty so recipients cannot learn that ignoring notifications is always safe (DR-10/DR-11), and silent releases are counted as measurable debt rather than forgotten (DR-12). RV-3 applies the TR-8 rule to the new field before it can be discovered as a defect: the class is recomputed from the signed bundle, never read from the receipt.

**What v1.3.6 changes.** This revision attacks the residual the document has carried unchanged since v1.2.0: **A-8**, the assumption that what an approver sees on screen corresponds to the bytes they sign. A compromised Attestation Presentation Service defeats every cryptographic control in this document, because the approver's signature is authentic and binds the *real* bytes — the lie happens upstream of the signature, where no verification reaches. §12.6's device re-render was the only mitigation and was a SHOULD.

**§9.6 (NEW) — deferred release.** Floor-HIGH actions are verified and then **held**. During a bounded hold window a summary rendered **independently from the canonical bytes** is delivered out-of-band to every attester and the operator; any recipient may repudiate; silence releases. A compromised presentation service can still obtain an approval — but it can no longer reach execution, because it does not control the notification path. **This raises the bar from one compromised component to two independent ones**, which is exactly the threshold INV-1-HIGH defines. It does not close A-8 and is not claimed to: an approver who ignores the notification is not protected, and the mechanism is detection-with-a-veto rather than prevention. Its virtue is that it costs the approver **nothing in the normal case** — no second device, no code to read, no extra click — which is why it survives real operational use where active-verification schemes decay.

**What v1.3.5 changes.** An adversarial pass over v1.3.4's own newest machinery — DS-6 and AT-8a, drafted one revision earlier — found **two defects in the fixes themselves**, consistent with the document's established pattern. (1) **Z3:** DS-6b required the Executor to verify the claimed `origin_nonce` was *a* consumed nonce, which is a membership test, not a pinning test; a compromised KMS substitutes any other consumed nonce, the idempotency key moves, and the action doubles — the RES-8 class, fourth recurrence, in the machinery the Y3 fix introduced. Closed by **DS-6f** (origin read from an immutable ledger binding, never from the receipt). (2) **Z4:** AT-8a fixed the canonicalizer but not the *schema*; an optional field admits two canonical encodings of one semantic object, two ids, two ledger slots, and T-14 amplification reopens through the mechanism Y1b closed. Closed by **AT-8b** (closed object schema). Both are mechanized in Annex D Part III. Additionally: `el1_migrate.py` closes the Z1 migration residual with an exhaustive per-bundle checker, and **ACP-CLASS-001** ships the suite-12 classification artifact that v1.3.4 made mandatory without providing.

**What v1.3.4 changes.** (1) The Y1 fix (AT-8 / TR-10 / step 7b) is **normative**, following independent confirmation that also reproduced Annex D at its published hash and re-ran the mutation control; (2) **Y3 is fixed** — DS-6 separates *action identity* from *authorization identity*, restoring exactly-once across the DS-3 re-drive path, mechanized in Annex D Part II; (3) **Y4 is actually implemented** — v1.3.3 dispositioned it in Annex C prose but never added `operator` to AT-1 or step 7b; (4) **AT-8a** pins the Attestation Object to one canonicalization, because AT-8 moved object hashing onto the binding path; (5) **EL-1** fixes a new finding (Z1): the expression grammar stated no operator precedence, and two evaluators written independently from the prose disagreed on 4.9% of mixed-connective cases; (6) **RK-2a** fixes Z2 — the document's own reference bundle used operators its own grammar did not define; (7) conformance suite **12** makes the RES-8/RES-9 field-and-relation classification table a shipping requirement, since it has now out-performed narrative review twice.

**What v1.3.2 changes.** Three things, all in the assurance story rather than the architecture: (1) the Annex B proof artifact has been **executed** — the published v1.3.1 obligations did not verify as written, and were completed by proof-body work only, with every lemma statement byte-identical (§1.1); (2) mutation testing was added as a negative control, which both confirmed the theorems are load-bearing and surfaced one honesty defect in a proof body (Annex C.3, X4); (3) a differential harness now binds production evaluators — the Policy Engine's and the Executor's TR-8 recomputation path — to the compiled verified model (B.7 item 4). No normative pipeline rule changed.

**Release integrity (new rule, from Annex C.3 X5).** Every published revision of this document is immutable. Any change to normative content or to the Annex B artifact — including a change of verification status — increments the version. A version string maps to exactly one document; two documents bearing the same version string is the collision defect that SR-1 and PB-5 prohibit in the system's own bundles, and the specification is not exempt from its own discipline.

Status is **Draft**, not Final. v1.2.0 was labelled "Final — no further substantive changes anticipated" while containing two single-component breaks of its own headline invariant. This document will not carry a Final label until an implementation exists and §14 suite 11's independent adversarial review — by a party that did not author or revise this document — has been performed and published.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

### 1.1 Verification Status of the Proof Artifact (Normative Disclosure)

The Dafny artifact in Annex B **has been executed**. Verification record:

| Item | Value |
| ------ | ------- |
| Toolchain | Dafny `4.9.1+452c307284e1511e5c2d10b9615f4c9c15f010e2`, bundled Z3 **4.12.1** (default solver) |
| Command | `dafny verify --function-syntax:4 ACP_RiskFunction_Proof.dfy` |
| Result | `Dafny program verifier finished with 62 verified, 0 errors`, exit code 0 |
| Per-assertion log | 62/62 `Outcome: Valid` (`--log-format text`, published per B.7) |
| Artifact | 772 lines, `sha256:152b97eed5928738e7aedc7d6c4c0392be851d3972bd22201132a3c1a01b1067` |
| Negative controls | 5/5 semantic mutants killed (B.2a); differential validation 20,014 cases, 0 disagreements (B.7 item 4) |

**Disclosure of the path to this result.** The artifact as published in v1.3.1 did **not** verify: `45 verified, 6 errors`, across four lemmas — `EvalRiskLevelAcc_ExtensionBound`, `Transposition_Invariance`, `Permutation_Invariance`, `BreadthFitsInt64`. Completing them required **proof-body work only**: seven helper lemmas were added (`RiskLeq_Reflexive`, `EvalRiskLevelAcc_AgreeFrom`, `Transposition_Invariance_From`, and a `pow2` monotonicity/valuation family) and the four failing bodies were filled in. A signature-level diff (every `lemma`/`function`/`predicate`/`requires`/`ensures`/`decreases` line) against the v1.3.1 inline copy shows **zero deletions and zero modifications — additions only**. Every theorem statement the specification cites is byte-identical to what it cited before verification.

Two verification passes were performed independently — one by the specification's author, one by the reviewing party preparing this revision — and converged on the **same helper-lemma decomposition** without coordination. That convergence is evidence that the proof structure is stable, not an accident of one prover's style. It is **not** a substitute for §14 suite 11: both parties were involved in this document's revision history, so the independent adversarial review remains outstanding and remains a conformance prerequisite.

The v1.3.0/v1.3.1 prediction that `Permutation_Invariance` was the lemma most likely to require manual effort was **correct in both senses**: it did fail as published (its body asserted a prefix lift the verifier could not discharge), and the required work was proof engineering — a downward induction from the swap index to 0 via `Transposition_Invariance_From` — not a statement change.

Any statement in this document of the form "X is proven" now means the corresponding Annex B obligation has been machine-verified under the record above. Model verification remains distinct from production implementation correctness; the differential suite (B.7 item 4) is what binds a deployment's binaries to the verified model, and a deployment claiming conformance **MUST** run it against its own build.

---

## 2. Abstract

Door A is an ingress-to-execution pipeline in which every artifact crossing a trust boundary is validated against a closed, rigid schema, every authorization decision is produced by a deterministic policy engine, and every execution is gated on cryptographic verification of that decision.

The architecture rests on two principles. Every invariant below is a consequence of one or both:

> **P-FLOOR.** Only cryptographically read-only inputs may *lower* computed risk. Any input the runtime or the Context Store can influence may only *raise* it.

> **P-LEDGER.** Authenticity is proven by a signature; freshness and single-use are proven by a linearizable monotonic ledger. Every once-valid artifact — receipt, attestation, bundle epoch — is consumed against that ledger.

The invariant family:

> **INV-1-HIGH.** No single compromised component can cause execution of an action that is **HIGH by signed floor** (§8.3.2), without a fresh, single-use, quorum-satisfying set of attestations bound to that action's canonical hash. Conditional on A-1 through A-8.

> **INV-1-MEDIUM.** No single compromised component *other than the Policy Engine, KMS, or Context Store* can cause an unauthorized MEDIUM-impact state change. A compromised Policy Engine or KMS can cause bounded unauthorized MEDIUM actions (rate-limited by RAD-1/2, detectable via audit replay). A compromised Context Store can cause unauthorized MEDIUM actions by raising or withholding capability facts.

> **INV-1-FLOOR.** No runtime component — including a fully compromised Context Store — can cause a resource to be evaluated at a tier below its signed floor. This is the mechanism by which INV-1-HIGH survives Context Store compromise, and is mechanized as `FloorDominance` (Annex B).

The pipeline achieves grammar-level immunity to instruction injection *for adapters that admit no free text*, deterministic containment of parameter-level abuse, bounded exposure to compositional attacks, and non-repudiable, tamper-evident audit of every decision.

### 2.1 Applicability and Use-Case Coverage

| # | Use case (example) | Ingress shape | Fidelity class (§6.1) | Provider class (§8.8) | Decisive control | Fit |
| --- | ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 1 | Computational science / drug-design task submission | Sequences, identifiers, assay parameters | F-HIGH | Static signed entitlements | Grammar + output validation | **Ideal** |
| 2 | Clinical / regulated data submission | Coded records, dosing schedules | F-HIGH | Static signed entitlements | Grammar + floor classification | **Ideal** |
| 3 | Threat-intelligence ingestion | Hashes, indicators, vulnerability IDs | F-HIGH | Workload attestation | Grammar + accumulators | **Ideal** |
| 4 | Batch / pipeline job control | Job enums, bounded input lists | F-HIGH | Workload attestation | Grammar + budget limits | **Ideal** |
| 5 | Industrial / operational setpoint changes | Bounded setpoints, predefined states | F-HIGH | Static or attestation | Parameter risk + receipts + at-most-once (§9.5) | **Strong** |
| 6 | Financial order / risk-parameter submission | Fixed ranges, instrument identifiers | F-HIGH | Static + live sync | Parameter risk + accumulators + at-most-once | **Strong** |
| 7 | Access & entitlement operations (human IT) | Closed operation set on identities/groups | F-HIGH structured, F-LOW if NL-fronted | Static preferred; live sync if churn demands | Floor tier + quorum + confirmation | **Strong** |
| 8 | Network-rule administration | Rule tuples: action, ranges, ports, protocol | F-HIGH structured, F-LOW if NL-fronted | Static or live sync | Parameter risk + quorum + confirmation | **Strong** |
| 9 | Read-only retrieval over curated corpora | Query identifiers, filter enums | F-HIGH | Any | Grammar + egress scoping | **Strong** (low stakes) |
| 10 | Free-form natural-language automation | Arbitrary text | **F-LOW** | Any | Confirmation (§8.6) + capability containment | **Conditional** |

**Reading rules.**

- Rows 1–4: ingress is naturally grammar-shaped and rights are stable. This is the architecture's home ground. Note that these rows also rarely need a model at all (B-5) — the strongest guarantee and the least inference coincide.
- Rows 5–6: the grammar holds, but harm lives in *values and sequences*. The deployment's real work is writing honest risk functions and accumulators. Additionally, these targets are typically non-idempotent; §9.5 applies.
- Rows 7–8: **corrected from v1.2.0**, which assigned these to Door A in one table and Door B in another. They are structured operations (F-HIGH) whenever the operator submits a typed tuple; they become F-LOW only if an NL adapter fronts them. The *provider class* (static vs live sync) is orthogonal to the fidelity class and must not be conflated with it.
- Row 10 is **no longer excluded**. It is admitted at F-LOW with mandatory confirmation (§8.6) and a higher disposition floor (§8.4). See §2.4 for why the exclusion was wrong.

### 2.2 Design Philosophy: Why Containment, Not Correction

> **A language model's input surface is a flaw by design, and the model cannot be patched.**

1. **The vulnerability is the feature.** A model that follows instructions in text cannot distinguish, with certainty, instructions it should follow from instructions it should not — both arrive in the same channel, in the same form. A system whose safety depends on the model *declining* to follow adversarial text has placed its security boundary inside the one component that structurally cannot hold it.
2. **Per-flaw correction does not terminate.** Each newly discovered injection technique would require retraining — slow, non-local, unverifiable, and obsolete at the next model version. Detection-based filtering (one model guarding another) is the same race with an extra participant.
3. **Therefore: never fix the model — remove its authority.** Every security-relevant decision lives in components that can be patched, tested, verified, and reasoned about. When a new attack technique is discovered, the response is a rule change, a schema constraint, or a floor reclassification — a signed bundle deploy, never a training run.
4. **Security claims are structural, never behavioral.** Nothing here asserts what the model *will do*; every guarantee asserts what its output *can reach*.

**Honest positioning (new in v1.3.0).** This premise is not novel. Capability-security literature, and DeepMind's CaMeL specifically, reach the same conclusion. The contribution of this document is not the insight but its *rigorization*: the invariant analysis, the conformance regime, the receipt and ledger construction, and the mechanized proof obligations. Readers evaluating novelty should evaluate those, not the premise.

### 2.3 Explicit Assumptions (Normative Preconditions)

Every invariant is conditional on all of the following. A deployment violating any assumption voids the corresponding guarantee.

**A-1. Client Application Trust.** The client application is trusted to represent the authenticated operator's intent *for F-HIGH adapters without confirmation configured*. Where confirmation is required (§8.6), this assumption is replaced by the operator's signed attestation, and A-1 is not relied upon. This is narrower than v1.2.0's A-1, which assumed client intent fidelity unconditionally.

**A-2. Clock Synchronization.** All receipt-issuing and receipt-verifying components maintain clocks disciplined by NTS (RFC 8915) within ±5 s skew.

**A-3. Cryptographic Primitive Security.** Ed25519, SHA-256, and nonce randomness are assumed secure per published analyses. Post-quantum threats are out of scope.

**A-4. Host Boundary.** The host kernel, hypervisor, and hardware beneath the container boundary are trusted.

**A-5. Formal Verification Baseline.** The risk-function evaluator *model* is total, monotone, and permutation-invariant — machine-verified per §1.1 and Annex B. What remains assumed per deployment is the **binding**: each production evaluator (the Policy Engine's step-8 evaluation and the Executor's TR-8 step-7 recomputation) MUST be validated against the compiled model by the differential suite (B.7 item 4). Until a deployment has run that suite against its own binaries, P-1/P-2 hold for that deployment as implementation requirements, not inherited properties.

**A-6. KMS Independence.** The receipt-signing substrate verifies bundle authenticity and epoch independently of the Policy Engine runtime (§9.1.1). If the KMS accepts bundle metadata from the Policy Engine without independent verification, INV-1-HIGH collapses.

**A-7. Honest Floors (NEW).** Each governable resource's signed floor tier reflects its true minimum sensitivity. **Understating a floor voids INV-1-HIGH for that resource.** This is the load-bearing assumption introduced by the floor/raise model: the architecture guarantees no runtime component can evaluate *below* the floor, but it cannot know whether the floor was set correctly. Floor maintenance is a two-person, offline-key operation (RK-5) precisely because it is where this assumption lives.

**A-8. Attestation Presentation Integrity (NEW).** The Attestation Presentation Service renders the canonical Proposal faithfully to the human, displays floor-derived values rather than Context-asserted ones, and displays the `proposal_hash` being signed. It is part of the TCB (§4.3). If it is compromised, quorum becomes a signature over a screen the humans did not understand.

**A-9. No Cross-Boundary Collusion (NEW — was implicit).** Operators are distinct principals and do not collude across component boundaries. Collusion spanning components (e.g. a Policy Engine operator with a Context Store operator, or two approvers) defeats INV-1-HIGH. v1.2.0 stated this only in §4.4, 130 sections after the invariant it conditions.

### 2.4 Why the Door A / Door B Binary Was Retired (Informative)

v1.2.0 excluded free-text ingress and defined a future "Door B" with a weaker guarantee and a mandatory intent-confirmation step (DB-1). This produced three problems.

First, an **inversion**: for an identical authorized operator, Door B had a mandatory intent check and Door A had none. Against a compromised client, the flagship "strong" door protected the operator *less* than the "weak" one.

Second, a **contradiction**: §2 claimed injection was structurally impossible, while §7.1 justified output-validation weakness by asserting the adversary controls prompt conditioning. Both could not hold for the same pipeline.

Third, a **utility gap**: the rows where the guarantee was strongest (1–4) are rows where a model contributes nothing, and the rows where a model would earn its place (7–8) were assigned to the weaker door.

The resolution: intent fidelity is a *dial*, not a *door*. Confirmation is a risk-proportional control available to any adapter. The strong-ingress case keeps its grammar-level injection immunity; the free-text case is admitted with confirmation mandatory and a raised disposition floor. One core serves both.

## 3. Terminology

| Term | Definition |
| ------ | ------------ |
| **Atom** | A single validated input object conforming to exactly one registered Input Schema. |
| **Proposal** | A candidate operation submitted to the Policy Engine: the envelope PR-1 fixes (§9.2) — the SR-5 triple, the fidelity class (§6.1), the tenant the admitting adapter's bundle names, and a closed payload of `task_type`, `operator`, `targets`, `params`, `cidrs`. |
| **Ingress Adapter** | A component converting external input into a Proposal, stamping a fidelity class. |
| **Fidelity class** | `F-HIGH` (no free text reaches the Proposal) or `F-LOW` (a translator model produced it). |
| **Input Schema** | A closed, versioned, registered schema defining one admissible input shape. |
| **Policy Engine** | The deterministic component mapping (Proposal, Bundle, Context) → Decision. |
| **Floor tier** | Bundle-signed minimum sensitivity of a resource. Read-only to the runtime. |
| **Raise tier** | Context-Store-served tier assertion. May only increase effective tier. |
| **Effective tier** | `max(floor, raise)`. |
| **Attestation** | A signed human act bound to a `proposal_hash`. Two kinds: **confirmation** (first-party, the operator) and **approval** (second-party, a distinct approver). |
| **Decision Receipt** | A signed, self-contained attestation of a Decision, verifiable by the Executor without trusting the Policy Engine's channel. |
| **Consumption Ledger** | The linearizable single-use registry consuming receipt nonces, attestation IDs, and bundle epochs (§9.3.1). |
| **Executor** | The component holding scoped credentials that performs real-world state changes. |
| **Context Store** | The state substrate supplying operator capabilities, tier raises, and accumulators. |
| **TCB** | The set of components whose compromise defeats INV-1 individually. Design objective: no single element defeats INV-1-HIGH alone (§10). |

| T-04 | Compositional attack | Session accumulators (§8.5) |
| T-05 | Policy Engine compromise | Signed receipts + Executor verification (§9) + KMS independence (§9.1.1) |
| T-06 | Executor compromise | Receipt requirement + scoped credentials + audit gap detection |
| T-07 | Policy tampering | Signed bundles, monotonic epoch (§8.2, §8.9) |
| T-08 | Audit tampering | Per-tenant hash chains + external anchoring (§11) |
| T-09 | Receipt replay | Nonce + expiry + consumption ledger (§9.3.1) |
| T-10 | TOCTOU on escalation | Attestation binding + revalidation (§8.6) + execution-time recheck for floor-HIGH (§9.3) |
| T-11 | Confused deputy via capability breadth | Floor tiers + parameter risk (§8.3) |
| T-12 | Schema-registry manipulation | Signed registry, decidable narrowing test (§6.5) |
| T-13 | Client intent misrepresentation | **Now in scope where confirmation is configured** (§8.6). Out of scope only for F-HIGH adapters without confirmation, per A-1. |
| T-14 | **Attestation amplification (NEW)** | One legitimate attestation reused across multiple receipts. Ledger consumption by attestation ID (§9.3.1) |
| T-15 | **Bundle rollback (NEW)** | Replay of a genuine but superseded, more permissive bundle. Monotonic `bundle_epoch` (§8.9 RAD-3) |
| T-16 | **Tier suppression (NEW)** | Falsifying a resource's tier downward to suppress escalation. Signed floor (§8.3.2), `FloorDominance` |
| T-17 | **Induced fail-closed → attestation flood (NEW)** | Tripping fail-closed controls to saturate the human quorum. Queue isolation (§8.6a) + queue-depth and arrival-rate monitoring (AQ-3). *Until v1.3.22 this cell cited "ES-6 monitoring", an id defined nowhere — see §1.* |
| T-18 | **Derived-risk forgery in the receipt (NEW in v1.3.1)** | A signing substrate asserts a lower floor-only risk or a stronger fidelity class than the bundle supports, suppressing the attestation requirement. Executor recomputation (TR-8, §9.3 steps 7/7a) |
| T-19 | **Attestation misbinding (v1.3.3)** | A compromised KMS attaches a genuine quorum raised for proposal P₁ to a receipt for attacker-chosen P₂; signatures verify but are not bound to P₂. Object transmission + binding check (AT-8, TR-10, §9.3 step 7b); mechanized in Annex D. **Fix NORMATIVE in v1.3.4** (independently confirmed). |
| T-20 | **Re-drive duplication (NEW in v1.3.4)** | A lost-outcome (`indeterminate`) floor-HIGH action is re-driven under a fresh attestation id, presenting the target a new idempotency key for an action that may already have committed — a doubled trade or actuator command. Action-identity key (DS-6), TR-10-verified; mechanized in Annex D. |
| T-28 | **Accumulator inflation (NEW in v1.3.10)** | Proposals attributed to a victim operator, then repudiated, increment counters for actions that never executed until a `deny`-effect accumulator locks the operator out. Count at release (AC-5). |
| T-29 | **Pre-anchor audit rewrite (NEW in v1.3.10)** | A compromised audit writer rewrites the record of an executed floor-HIGH action inside the ≤ 10 min anchoring gap, erasing the evidence §11.3 reconciliation depends on. Anchor before release (AU-7). |
| T-30 | **Anchor denial → approver fatigue (NEW in v1.3.10)** | Denying anchoring forces the ATTEST cap to compound with DR-9 until approvers rubber-stamp. Suspend sampling or fail closed (AU-6). |
| T-27 | **Suite downgrade (NEW in v1.3.8)** | A compromised issuer re-signs with a classical-only suite to escape post-quantum protection, or strips one half of a hybrid signature. Bundle-signed suite floor (CR-4), conjunctive composition (CR-3), `alg` signature-covered (CR-5). |
| T-25 | **Reversibility downgrade (NEW in v1.3.7)** | A compromised KMS asserts `REVERSIBLE` for an irreversible action to suppress the DR-9 acknowledgement requirement — the X1 pattern applied to a new field. Executor recomputes the class from the signed bundle (RV-3); receipt value is never read. |
| T-26 | **Notification habituation (NEW in v1.3.7)** | Not an attacker capability but a system effect: if silence always releases, recipients stop reading, and the detection channel decays into a log while appearing operational. DR-9 (silence never releases the irreversible class), DR-10 (sampling), DR-12 (silence is counted). |
| T-24 | **Display lie (A-8, mitigated in v1.3.6)** | A compromised Attestation Presentation Service shows a benign action while the canonical bytes describe a floor-HIGH one; approvers sign authentically and in good faith. No cryptographic control reaches this — the lie precedes the signature. Deferred release (§9.6): an independently rendered summary reaches the same humans out-of-band before execution, and any of them may veto. |
| T-22 | **Origin substitution (NEW in v1.3.5)** | A compromised KMS names a different consumed nonce as a re-drive's origin, moving the idempotency key so the target cannot dedup a floor-HIGH action that already committed. Ledger-pinned origin binding (DS-6f). |
| T-23 | **Attestation encoding split (NEW in v1.3.5)** | An optional Attestation Object field yields two canonical encodings, two ids, and two ledger slots for one attestation, reopening T-14. Closed object schema (AT-8b). |
| T-21 | **Expression parse divergence (NEW in v1.3.4)** | An ambiguous `&&`/` | | ` grammar lets the Policy Engine and Executor parse one bundle rule into different trees, or lets a bundle author's intent diverge silently from evaluated meaning. EL-1 precedence rule; suite 8 parser vectors. |

### 4.2 Explicitly Out of Scope

- **Semantically valid, dual-use domain inputs.** A syntactically valid molecule or trading parameter that is harmful *in the domain sense* is not detectable here. Domain screening (§7.4) is a separate layer deployments in sensitive domains MUST add.
- **Availability.** No availability SLO is specified. **But note:** DoS is not fully severable from safety — see RES-2 (§15), which discloses the induced-fail-closed composition rather than hiding behind this exclusion.
- **Compromise below the container boundary.**
- **Timing side channels in policy evaluation.** v1.2.0 prohibited short-circuit evaluation "because it leaks timing." That claim was contradicted by its own proof artifact and is retired; see §8.3.1.
- **Exactly-once execution against non-idempotent external targets.** Unachievable without target participation; §9.5 specifies what is achievable instead.

### 4.3 Trust Classification

| Component | Trust Class |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Ingress Adapter (F-HIGH) | Trusted for shape, not for intent |
| Ingress Adapter (F-LOW) / translator model | **Untrusted.** Always. |
| Input / Output Schema Validator | Trusted (deterministic, small, testable) |
| LLM (any provider, any model) | **Untrusted.** Always. |
| Policy Engine | Trusted but **not solely relied upon** (receipts, §9) |
| Context Store | Trusted for *raises* only. **Cannot lower** effective tier (§8.3.2). |
| **Attestation Presentation Service (NEW)** | **TCB.** Per A-8. Compromise defeats quorum. |
| **Bundle Repository (NEW)** | **TCB.** Write-isolated from the Policy Engine host at a boundary stronger than filesystem permissions (§9.1.1). |
| **Consumption Ledger (NEW)** | **TCB.** Compromise permits replay and attestation amplification. |
| Executor | Trusted but **not solely relied upon** |
| Audit subsystem | Trusted for evidence, hardened per §11 |
| Network between components | Untrusted (mTLS REQUIRED) |

### 4.4 Compositional Attack Scope (Normative Boundary)

Explicitly out of scope for the baseline accumulator model: **cross-window composition** (patience attacks spanning window boundaries), **cross-operator collusion** (see A-9 — this now appears as a stated precondition, not only here), and **cross-session persistence** (fresh session credentials reset session-scoped accumulators).

Deployments requiring resistance MUST: (a) extend windows and groupings, (b) raise sensitive **floors** to force quorum, or (c) add workload attestation.

### 5.1a The two doors (Normative principle)

The architecture has exactly two paths out of the model, and their treatment is deliberately asymmetric.

*Not the pair PB-11 names.* The two doors of this section are the model's two **exits** — action and text. PB-11 and DR-14 (§9.6) use the same phrase for the two channels **to the human** during a deferred release, the Attestation Presentation Service and the notification service; those are doors because DR-2 requires a human to be reached through two of them, and they have nothing to do with the A/B binary §2.4 retired. Same word, different pair; PB-11 says so from its side.

**Door B — text.** The model's only channel is text-in/text-out (B-2). Door B carries no constraint on *content*: the model may be manipulated, injected, jailbroken or simply wrong, and the architecture takes no position on how often that happens. Door B is safe because it is **inert**, not because it is filtered.

This is not a gap. Text is an unbounded set; there is no closed grammar of safe sentences, and any check over it is necessarily statistical. §14's mutation discipline states the consequence: a control for which no falsifying test can be written cannot carry an invariant. **Door B therefore MUST NOT be relied upon for any security property**, and an implementation that adds a content filter and then relaxes a Door A control on the strength of it is non-conformant.

**Door A — action.** Every effect on the world passes Door A: a typed Proposal under the §6 closed grammar, risk recomputed from the signed bundle (TR-8), attestations bound to the action's canonical hash, quorum where the floor requires it, and release. **There MUST be no third route.** Any component capable of causing an external effect on the strength of anything other than a verified Decision Receipt (B-4) is a Door A bypass and a conformance failure.

**Why the asymmetry is principled.** Door A is controllable because actions are a **closed, typed, enumerable** set: each has a declared risk function and reversibility class, so a decision about one is a computation over trusted bytes rather than a judgement about meaning. Door B is uncontrollable for the mirror-image reason. Attempting to control Door B trades a mechanical guarantee for a statistical one; refusing to try, and removing consequence instead, is what makes the guarantee available at all.

This is the parameterised-query argument one layer up. The fix for injection was never better sanitisation of the shared channel — it was ensuring content on that channel could not become a statement. B-2 is that separation: Door B cannot be promoted to Door A.

**Corollary (B-5).** Most work never needs Door A, and much of it never needs the model. The fast path stays fast deliberately: a control plane that taxes cheap, reversible work gets routed around, and a control that is routed around provides nothing.

### 5.2 Boundary Rules (Normative)

- **B-1.** Every artifact crossing an arrow **MUST** be schema-validated at the receiving side, except (6)→(7) which is receipt-verified.
- **B-1a.** The canonical Proposal (or its hash-preimage) **MUST** be transmitted to the Executor alongside the Decision Receipt, over the same mTLS channel, canonicalized identically before hashing (§9.2).
- **B-2.** The model **MUST NOT** have tool access, network egress, function calling, or any channel other than text-in/text-out. Provider-side tool features **MUST** be disabled at the API-request level and this **MUST** be asserted in the audit record for every model call.
- **B-3.** Raw model output **MUST NOT** be transmitted to any component other than the Output Validator, nor logged verbatim into rendering systems without neutralization (§7.3).
- **B-4.** The Executor **MUST NOT** accept any instruction from any channel other than a verified Decision Receipt.
- **B-5.** Many tasks require no model at all. Implementations **SHOULD** prefer the LLM-free path whenever the task is expressible without inference. The model is a cost and a risk, never a default.
- **B-6 (NEW).** The fidelity class **MUST** be stamped by the adapter, carried in the Proposal, bound into the Decision and receipt, and **MUST NOT** be settable by the client.

---

## 6. Layer 1 — Ingress Adapters and Input Validation

### 6.1 Fidelity Classes (Normative)

- **FC-1.** Every adapter **MUST** declare exactly one fidelity class.
  - **F-HIGH**: no free text reaches the Proposal. Every field is a bounded scalar, constrained string, enum, or fixed-shape nested model. Instruction injection into the Proposal is grammatically impossible.
  - **F-LOW**: a translator model produced the Proposal from free text. Injection into the *translation step* is possible by construction; containment rests on capability limits, confirmation, and receipts — never on ingress hygiene.
- **FC-2.** Policy **MAY** condition on fidelity class. For F-LOW Proposals targeting effective tier ≥ T2, policy **MUST** require confirmation (§8.6) and **SHOULD** impose stricter disposition than for an identical F-HIGH Proposal.
- **FC-3.** No security claim may rest on length, encoding, or rate checks at an F-LOW ingress. These are cost and noise controls.
- **FC-4.** F-LOW deployments are limited to single-action, confirmation-gated operations until multi-step decomposition semantics are specified (§15, open problems).

### 6.2 Validator Requirements

- **V-1.** Validation **MUST** reject unknown fields (`extra='forbid'` in Pydantic v2, on every schema). `extra='ignore'` is a conformance failure.
- **V-2.** Free-form containers are prohibited: `dict`, `Any`, untyped `list`, `str` without pattern+length bounds, and `bytes` **MUST NOT** appear in any Input Schema. If a schema "needs flexibility," it is two schemas.
- **V-3.** Every string field **MUST** declare an anchored regular expression over an explicit allowlist character class, and a maximum length.
- **V-4.** Every numeric field **MUST** declare closed bounds (`ge`/`le`).
- **V-5.** Total serialized request size **MUST** be capped **before parsing** (§13).
- **V-6.** Parsing **MUST** use a hardened JSON parser with duplicate-key rejection at **all nesting depths**, depth limit, and no extension syntax. Duplicate keys are a hard reject at any level, never last-wins.
- **V-7.** String inputs **MUST** be NFC-normalized before pattern matching, and the normalized form is canonical downstream. Inputs containing bidirectional controls (U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069), zero-width characters (U+200B–U+200D, U+FEFF), or code points outside the declared class **MUST** be rejected.
- **V-8.** Closed-world on task types: `task_type` is a `Literal` over the registered set. No dynamic dispatch, no plugins.
- **V-9.** The validator **MUST** be side-effect-free and constant-shape.
- **V-10.** The validator **MUST** refuse to load if any external policy dependency is absent, stale, or fails signature verification against the active bundle.
- **V-11 (NEW).** The envelope union **MUST** be discriminated on `task_type`, and the validator **MUST** reject any envelope whose payload `task_type` disagrees with its `schema_id`.

### 6.4 Rejection Semantics

- **R-1.** Rejection **MUST** be fail-closed, fast (<5 ms target), and **uninformative to the caller**: a fixed-shape 400 with a coarse reason class and an `audit_id`. Field-level diagnostics go to audit only — precise errors are a grammar-probing oracle.
- **R-2.** Rejected raw input **MUST** be stored hash-only by default, with full capture switchable per tenant under explicit retention policy. Rejected input **MUST NOT** flow to any model.
- **R-3.** Every rejection **MUST** produce an audit record and feed the accumulators.

### 6.5 Schema Registry and Change Control

- **SR-1.** Schemas are content-addressed: `schema_id` + `schema_version` (semver) + `schema_hash`.
- **SR-2.** The registry is part of the signed bundle. The validator **MUST** refuse to start on signature or hash mismatch.
- **SR-3 (REVISED).** Schema changes follow the bundle change-control path. A change is **narrowing** iff the new admissible set is a provable subset of the old, decided over the bounded lattice (character class × length bound × enum set × numeric range):
  - new character class ⊆ old, **and**
  - new max length ≤ old, **and**
  - new enum set ⊆ old, **and**
  - new numeric interval ⊆ old.

  Any change not provably narrowing in **every** dimension is **widening** and takes the distinct-reviewer path. Changes whose direction is undecidable default to widening. v1.2.0 left "narrowing" undefined, permitting a net-widening change (e.g. `^[a-z]{1,10}$` → `^[a-z0-9]{1,8}$`) to self-classify as narrowing and bypass review.
- **SR-4.** At most **32** registered schemas per tenant. A design-pressure limit, not a technical one.
- **SR-5.** Every Atom, Proposal, Decision, and audit record carries the `(schema_id, schema_version, schema_hash)` triple and the fidelity class.
- **SR-6.** A schema unused for 90 days is DEPRECATED; removed after 180. Proposals referencing a removed schema receive DENY (`schema_retired`).

## 7. Layer 2 — Model Boundary and Output Validation

### 7.1 The Containment Rule (Rewritten)

v1.2.0 asserted both that injection was structurally impossible and that "the adversary controls the conditioning signal via prompt injection." These are incompatible. The corrected statement distinguishes two mechanisms:

- **Instruction injection** — attacker text is interpreted as instructions by the model. For **F-HIGH** adapters this is eliminated: the prompt is template-assembled (M-3, M-6) from validated, bounded, pattern-constrained fields, so there is no channel through which free text reaches the model. For **F-LOW** adapters it is **possible by construction**.
- **Value conditioning** — the attacker chooses *which* allowlisted values appear in the template, steering generation without injecting instructions. This is **not** eliminated for either class. A field constrained to `^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$` still lets an adversary choose among ~10^47 strings; the grammar bounds the alphabet, not the semantics.

Output validation therefore constrains what a compromised model can **emit**, not what it can be **conditioned toward**. That residual is bounded by downstream policy (§8), not eliminated by the Output Schema.

- **O-1.** Every model output influencing any downstream component **MUST** validate against a registered Output Schema meeting V-1..V-11.
- **O-1a.** Implementers **MUST NOT** treat output validation as equivalent in strength to input validation.
- **O-2.** Output Schemas are registered, versioned, and signed exactly as Input Schemas.
- **O-3.** A failing output **MUST** be discarded (never repaired, never partially accepted), audited with raw output preserved, and counted in accumulators. Retries **MAY** be attempted up to §13's limit; the retry prompt **MUST NOT** include the failed output.
- **O-4.** For generative tasks, the Output Schema constrains alphabet and bounds, and the artifact flows to domain screening (§7.4), not to the Executor.

### 7.2 Model Invocation Constraints

- **M-1.** Tool/function-calling **MUST** be disabled in the API request; configuration captured in audit.
- **M-2.** Model ID **MUST** be pinned to an immutable dated snapshot from the signed bundle. Floating aliases are prohibited. A model version change is a policy change.
- **M-3.** The prompt **MUST** be template-generated from the canonical Atom only. The template is part of the signed bundle.
- **M-4.** Max output tokens bounded per Output Schema. Truncated output is a validation failure.
- **M-5.** Per-call timeout, per-tenant concurrency cap, per-tenant daily budget REQUIRED. Exhaustion fails closed.
- **M-6.** Templates **SHALL** be logic-less: variable interpolation and static section inclusion only. Turing-complete template engines are prohibited.
- **M-7.** Model versions may be revoked via emergency bundle update: in-flight calls complete under heightened output validation; new calls fail closed for 24 h; the revoked version is permanently barred.

### 7.3 Neutralization for Human-Facing Surfaces

Any surface rendering pipeline data to humans **MUST** treat all fields — including validated ones — as data, never markup: context-appropriate encoding, no HTML interpretation, no terminal escape passthrough. Attestation surfaces **MUST** render from the canonical structure via fixed templates, never echo raw model text. An approver reading attacker-influenced prose is an injection target; T-02 includes humans.

### 7.4 Domain Screening Attachment Point (Informative)

Between Output Validation and the Policy Engine, deployments **MAY** insert a domain-screening stage. Contract: consumes a validated artifact, returns `PASS` or `FAIL(reason_class)`, is versioned in the bundle, and its verdict enters the Proposal as a field policy can rule on. This specification defines the socket, not the screen.

---

## 8. Layer 3 — Deterministic Policy Engine

### 8.1 Determinism Contract

- **P-1.** `Evaluate(Proposal, PolicyBundle, Context) → Decision` is a pure function of its three arguments. No LLM, no randomness, no network I/O, no clock reads inside evaluation — the evaluation timestamp is an *input*.
- **P-2.** Identical arguments **MUST** produce byte-identical Decisions, covered by golden-file replay in CI.
- **P-3.** Every Decision carries its `policy_bundle_hash` and `bundle_epoch`. Decisions are replayable bit-for-bit from audit.
- **P-4.** Default is DENY: no matching rule, unknown capability, unclassified resource, unavailable Context Store — each with a distinct reason code. **Unknown is never LOW.**
- **P-5 (REVISED).** P-1..P-3 hold as machine-verified properties of the Annex B model (§1.1). For production binaries they are enforced by golden-file replay (P-2) plus the differential suite (B.7 item 4), which **MUST** cover both evaluation points TR-8 created: the Policy Engine evaluator and the Executor's floor-only recomputation path. Evaluator drift between the two is exactly what §9.3 step 7a cannot distinguish from KMS compromise, so the differential suite is the control that keeps step 7a's alert semantics clean.

```

- **PB-1.** The bundle **MUST** be signed with an offline key held by the security-policy role, distinct from all runtime keys. The engine **MUST** refuse to serve with an invalid or expired bundle (a grace window MAY be configured during which all Decisions are capped at ATTEST).
- **PB-2.** Author and reviewer identities **MUST** differ.
- **PB-3.** The engine holds exactly one active bundle; activation is atomic; in-flight evaluations complete under the bundle they started with.
- **PB-4.** Runtime components — including a fully compromised Policy Engine — possess no key capable of producing a valid bundle signature. Policy is read-only to the runtime **by cryptography**, not file permissions.
- **PB-5 (NEW).** `manifest.json` **MUST** carry a strictly increasing integer `bundle_epoch`. Epochs are never reused or decreased.
- **PB-6 (NEW in v1.3.15 — Normative).** The attester registry **MUST** carry an integer `quorum_k` ≥ 1: the number of **distinct approvals** a floor-HIGH action requires. It is signed policy, inside the bundle tree and therefore inside `policy_bundle_hash`, and it is the **only** authoritative source of that number (AT-9).

  *Rationale.* Until v1.3.15 no clause named a field to hold the threshold, while §9.3 step 7b(iii) required the Attestation Object's count to equal "the bundle rule's" — a comparison against a value the document never defined. An implementation reading the whole reference carefully could not locate the bundle side of that equality, and the reference itself took the count from the object instead. A requirement whose left-hand side is undefined is not a requirement. `quorum_k` = 1 is permitted and is a deployment choice, but it collapses INV-1-HIGH to single-compromise and a deployment choosing it **MUST** disclose that in its residual-risk statement rather than discover it later.
- **PB-7 (NEW in v1.3.15 — Normative; EXTENDED in v1.3.30 by HM-5 to `webauthn` entries, compared over `public_key`). Attester verification keys MUST be pairwise distinct.** No two registry identities may carry the same verification key, compared over the **complete suite** — two identities differing in their classical key but sharing a post-quantum key are not distinct, and treating them as such is CR-3's conjunctive guarantee undone at the registry instead of at the verifier. An engine **MUST** refuse a bundle whose registry violates this, at load, as an invalid bundle under PB-1.

  *Rationale.* AT-2 requires approvers to be "mutually distinct" without saying what distinguishes them, and `quorum_k` counts approvals by identity. A registry mapping two names onto one key therefore lets the holder of one private key produce two signatures over two objects differing only in their attestation nonces, label them with the two names, and satisfy k = 2 alone — INV-1-HIGH defeated by a single compromise, by a route that requires no defect anywhere in the verification path. This is a **well-formedness** property of the bundle, not a check on the quorum path: a registry that cannot support its own threshold is invalid for every component that reads it, and enforcing it only where quorum is counted would leave every other reader believing it sound.

  *Conformance note.* This constraint is **not expressible in JSON Schema** — `uniqueItems` applies to arrays and there is no keyword for uniqueness across the values of a map. Implementations validating the registry by schema alone are non-conformant however cleanly they validate; the check belongs in the loader.

- **PB-8 (NEW in v1.3.15 — Normative). The `SIGNATURE` file carries the DECLARED SUITE and one signature value per primitive that suite requires**, over SHA-256 of the canonical bundle tree. A verifier **MUST** verify it conjunctively under CR-3: the values present must be exactly those the declared suite requires, and every one of them must verify. The declared suite **MUST** be inside the tree hash, and the file itself **MUST NOT** be a member of the tree it covers.

  *Rationale.* Until v1.3.15 the file listing above described this artifact as "Ed25519 over SHA-256 of canonical bundle tree" — naming a single classical primitive — while Part V requires hybrid composition and CR-3 requires it conjunctively. The two statements are not reconcilable, and the file listing is the one an implementer reads while building the bundle. An implementation following it emits a classical-only signature over the highest-leverage artifact in the system and is **CR-3 non-conformant while conforming to the sentence it read**, which is the failure mode a specification is supposed to remove rather than create. The post-quantum leg is absent by construction, so no verifier can detect its absence as tampering.

  Two consequences are stated because both were reached by getting them wrong first. The suite must be **inside** the hash, or an attacker relabels a hybrid bundle as classical, the verifier obligingly requires one primitive, and the downgrade costs nothing — the guarantee CR-3 exists for becomes decorative at the point it is loaded. And the signature must be **outside** the tree, because a member's digest would have to be known before the file existed; excluding it by name at the bundle root, rather than by extension or by suffix anywhere, keeps a nested file of the same name covered.

- **PB-9 (NEW in v1.3.21 — Normative; EXTENDED in v1.3.30 by HM-5 to a `webauthn-ed25519` credential, and to an ES256 key that is not a point on secp256r1). No registry identity may carry a classical verification key of small order.** An engine **MUST** refuse, at load and as an invalid bundle under PB-1, a registry whose `classical` leg decodes to an Ed25519 point of order dividing 8 — under such a key one signature verifies every message (RFC 8032 as written permits it; the strict verifier CR-3 requires refuses it), so the identity is a forgery oracle rather than an attester, and without this clause the verifier's refusal stood alone between enrolment and INV-1-HIGH while reporting the fault as the attester's.

- **PB-10 (NEW in v1.3.23 — Normative). Every critical alert has a signed audience.** The bundle **MUST** carry `alert_targets.json` (§8.2): a map from **alert class** to a non-empty set of recipient identities, inside the tree hash. A component raising a critical alert **MUST** address it to the recipients the signed bundle names for that alert's class, and **MUST NOT** address it to an audience it configures for itself. A bundle that names **no** recipients for **any** of the classes below is invalid and **MUST** be refused at load by every consumer, on PB-1's footing: a policy under which some compromise would be detected by nobody is not a policy this document can serve under.

  The classes, and what each carries. Where a clause is listed the mapping is normative; an implementation **MUST** map every critical alert it raises to exactly one class, and where this document does not name the raising clause the class is the implementation's choice — but the mapping **MUST** be total, because an alert with no class has no audience, and an alert with no audience is the thing this clause exists to refuse.
  - `BUNDLE_INVALID` — a bundle refused at load or on re-verification: PB-1 through PB-9, CR-4 applied to the bundle itself, RAD-4.
  - `SIGNING_SUBSTRATE` — the KMS refused, or is behaving as a compromised one would: `SIGNING_DENIED` (§9.1.1 step 7), RAD-2, RAD-3, RAD-5.
  - `RECEIPT_INVALID` — a receipt the Executor refuses on its own bytes: §9.3 steps 1–5, AB-6, WE-4, L-14, L-17, DS-6b, EX-3.
  - `RECOMPUTATION_MISMATCH` — a validly signed receipt the bundle does not support: §9.3 step 7a (TR-8, RV-3) and the §9.2 note on the authority of receipt fields.
  - `ATTESTATION_INVALID` — a quorum that does not compose: §9.3 step 7b (0)–(vi), AB-0 through AB-4, AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, AT-8, AT-8b, AT-9, AT-10, INV-1-HIGH.
  - `LEDGER_REPLAY` — a consumed identifier or a rebound origin: CL-2, CL-3, DS-6e, DS-6f.
  - `SUITE_BELOW_FLOOR` — CR-4 applied to a receipt, an attestation or an acknowledgement (L-31).
  - `DEFERRED_RELEASE` — the deferred door: DR-2, DR-4, DR-6, DR-8, ACK-1 and every acknowledgement refusal beneath it.
  - `AUDIT_INTEGRITY` — the chain or its anchors: AU-4, AU-6, AU-7, AU-8.
  - `ATTESTATION_QUEUE_DEPTH` — AQ-3 (T-17).
  - `CONTEXT_STORE` — the Context Store disagrees with what was decided: §8.7.1's capability-delta detection, and §9.3 step 9's revocation between issuance and execution (T-10).

  *Why the audience is here and not in the notifier's, the KMS's or the deployment's configuration.* A service that selects its own alert audience is certifying its own coverage — RES-8, and the shape of finding **T-32** one component over (open until v1.3.25 — PB-11, DR-14). DR-13(2) refused exactly that for the fast-path notice and put the recipient set under signed policy, keyed by class, with a class naming nobody failing closed; it is mutation-proven. Critical alerts take the **identical** mechanism rather than a second one — two mechanisms for one problem is the two-definitions defect — and the same words: a notice with no addressee is not a detection channel, and neither is an alert.

  *Why load-time, and not raise-time.* A notice's "fail closed" has an action to withhold. An alert is raised on a path that has already failed, so refusing at raise time would withhold nothing. What can be withheld is the bundle: a deployment either names who is woken for each class, or it does not run. Every consumer that loads the bundle checks the whole list, not the classes it happens to raise, because a bundle is one signed artifact and its validity cannot depend on who is reading it.

  *What this does not decide.* The transport of an alert — pager, queue, webhook — and what acknowledgement closes it out. Those are deployment obligations in DR-12's shape, silence as measurable debt, and belong in ZIFFER-DEPLOY-001; a bundle that named a channel would put a routing detail under RK-5 two-person control, which is why `notice_targets` holds identities and not addresses and this file does the same. Found while building the KMS as a service, where every "critical alert" sentence in this document landed on a seam whose only implementation was a no-op (ACP-134).

- **PB-11 (NEW in v1.3.25 — Normative). The two doors have signed identities, and the bundle names them.** The bundle **MUST** carry `door_identities.json` (§8.2): the Attestation Presentation Service (`presentation`) and the notification service (`notification`), each an identity name and one verification key per primitive of the bundle's suite, in the attester registry's key shape, inside the tree hash. The two identities **MUST** be distinct over the **complete suite**, exactly as PB-7 requires of attesters and for the same reason: two names on one key are one door wearing two hats. A bundle missing either identity, or naming the same key for both, is invalid and **MUST** be refused at load by every consumer, on PB-1's footing. A Rendered Summary (DR-14) that verifies under neither key, or under the other role's key, **MUST** be refused.

  *Why the identities live here and not in either service's configuration.* Who may speak for a door is the same kind of value as who may attest (PB-6, PB-7), who is told (DR-13) and who is woken (PB-10): a service that names its own identity is certifying its own independence — RES-8, and the shape T-32 was open on from v1.3.11 to v1.3.24. Under RK-5 two-person control the pair changes the way a floor changes, with a review; under a service's configuration it changes the way a deployment does, without one.

  *Conformance note.* As with PB-7, distinctness across two values is not expressible in JSON Schema; the check belongs in the loader, and a loader validating by schema alone is non-conformant however cleanly it validates.

  *Not §5.1a's pair.* §5.1a's Door A and Door B are the model's two exits, action and text — a principle, not two pipelines, since §2.4. The doors this clause names are the two channels to the human that DR-2 keeps independent, called doors since v1.3.6 because a human must pass through both before a floor-HIGH action runs. Same word, different pair; §5.1a says so from its side, and the roles here are wire identifiers, which is why the collision is disclosed rather than renamed.

- **PB-12 (NEW in v1.3.27 — Normative). The receipt signing identity has a signed home, and the bundle names it.** The bundle **MUST** carry `receipt_identity.json`: the tenant's receipt verification keys, one per primitive of the bundle's suite, in the attester registry's key shape and under RK-5's two-person control. §9.3 step 1 verifies the receipt under these keys **and under nothing else** — a receipt key read from the Executor's own configuration is a transmitted identity trusted one level below the bundle, and step 1's words *from the signed bundle* had named a member §8.2's tree did not have. The KMS **MUST** compare the identity it holds for the tenant against the one the bundle it independently verified names, at §9.1.1 step 4, and answer `SIGNING_DENIED` on a mismatch — RAD-5's shape, applied to the key rather than to the tenant. Absent, malformed or one leg short ⇒ invalid bundle, refused at load by every consumer on PB-1's footing (`ReceiptIdentityAbsent`); PB-9's small-order rule applies to the classical leg. **No distinctness bar** against the attester registry or the two doors, deliberately: at any k ≥ 2 a KMS that also held one attester key still needs a second approver, so INV-1-HIGH is not broken by that component alone and the bar would remove no compromise while dressing an arbitrary rule as a control — the reference has recorded that reasoning beside its door check, and it applies unchanged here. EX-4's rule that no component *holds* private keys from more than one class is custody, enforced at the KMS, not by comparing public keys in a file.

  *Why now.* Through v1.3.26 the Python reference held the key as a field of its modelled bundle and hashed it there, so `policy_bundle_hash` covered a value the on-disk tree did not; the Rust differential passed it in beside the bundle; and the first Executor process would have read it from its own configuration. The member every implementation had assumed is now the one they all read.

- **PB-13 (NEW in v1.3.30 — Normative, ACP-287). The deployment's limits are signed policy, and the bundle declares them.** The bundle **MAY** carry `limits.json` (§8.2): three integers — `attestation_window_seconds` (1 … 3600; the Attestation Object's `expires_at` is its issue instant plus this, AT-1, under L-15's ceiling), `hold_window_seconds` (30 … 119; DR-1's hold, at or above L-28's floor and below L-14's receipt validity so that DR-6 is satisfiable), and `sample_percent` (0 … 100; DR-10's fraction, as a percentage). **Every field is optional, and absent means this document's own default** — 3600, 60 and 10 — the AT-10 reading: a permissive default taken openly, so that no bundle written before this member existed is invalidated by it, and a bundle that omits the file reads as every field at its default. A deployment that wants the document's numbers may say nothing; one that wants anything else **MUST** sign it here, and an implementation **MUST NOT** read any of the three from its own configuration. A value outside its range is an invalid bundle under PB-1 (`LimitOutOfBounds`), refused at load by every consumer and **never clamped**: a clamped limit is a limit nobody chose. A present file that is not an object, or a field that is not an integer, is `Malformed`. Integers only, for AT-8a's reason one artifact over: a float in signed policy is a canonicalisation question, and DR-10's own unit is a percentage.

  *Why now.* DR-1 and DR-10 have said *bundle-configured* since v1.3.7, and no member carried either value, so every implementation read the hold window and the sampling rate from its own environment — a number this document calls signed policy, set per process by whoever runs it. L-15 gave the attestation window a ceiling and no home, so the one engine that issues attestations used the ceiling as the window and wrote down why: shortening it would be that binary choosing how long a human has to approve. It was right, and the place the number lives is here. What this does **not** give the Executor is a way to *verify* the window: AT-1's object carries `expires_at` and no issue instant, so only the issuer knows the length; the declared value governs the issuer, and the bundle is signed. L-25's re-drive maximum and L-23's queue depth are also called bundle-configured and have no reader in any implementation; each joins this member with its first reader, because a field nothing reads is documentation shaped like a control (the RV-1 lesson, v1.3.15).

### 8.3 Parameter-Sensitive Risk

Static per-action risk ("modify_firewall_rule = HIGH") is insufficient: risk is a function of *parameters and targets*, not action names.

- **RK-1.** Every governable resource **MUST** carry a **floor** tier in `floors.json`: `T0` (public/sandbox), `T1` (internal), `T2` (production), `T3` (privileged). Resources absent from `floors.json` **MUST** be treated as `T3`.
- **RK-2.** Risk is computed by deterministic risk functions over the Proposal's parameters and the **effective tier** of its targets.

```json
{
  "risk_functions": [
    {
      "applies_to": "add_user_to_group",
      "base": "LOW",
      "raise_to": [
        {"if": "resource.effective_tier >= T2", "then": "MEDIUM"},
        {"if": "resource.effective_tier == T3", "then": "HIGH"},
        {"if": "access_level == 'owner' && resource.effective_tier >= T2", "then": "HIGH"},
        {"if": "fidelity == 'F-LOW' && resource.effective_tier >= T2", "then": "HIGH"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "applies_to": "modify_firewall_rule",
      "base": "MEDIUM",
      "raise_to": [
        {"if": "action == 'allow' && source_cidr.prefixlen <= 8", "then": "HIGH"},
        {"if": "action == 'allow' && port in SENSITIVE_PORTS", "then": "HIGH"},
        {"if": "destination.effective_tier >= T2 && action != 'deny'", "then": "MEDIUM"},
        {"if": "action == 'delete' && rule.effective_tier == T3", "then": "HIGH"}
      ],
      "constants": {
        "SENSITIVE_PORTS": [22, 23, 445, 1433, 3306, 3389, 5432, 5985, 5986]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **RV-1 (NEW in v1.3.7 — Normative).** Every action class **MUST** carry a **reversibility class** in the signed bundle's `reversibility.json`: `REVERSIBLE` (the action's effect can be undone by a further governed action without external cost) or `IRREVERSIBLE` (it cannot — funds moved, data destroyed, a physical actuator fired, a trade executed). **Action classes absent from `reversibility.json` MUST be treated as `IRREVERSIBLE`.** This mirrors RK-1's absent-⇒-T3 rule for the same reason: an unclassified action is treated as the most dangerous kind, so forgetting to classify fails safe rather than silently downgrading a control.

  *Where this default has effect (CLARIFIED in v1.3.15).* Through v1.3.14 it had effect **only on the deferred path**, because DR-1 scopes that path to floor-HIGH and nothing below HIGH read the class. An unclassified action on a T0 resource therefore defaulted to `IRREVERSIBLE` and then executed exactly as if it had defaulted to `REVERSIBLE` — a fail-safe default that changed no outcome is documentation, not a control. **DR-13 gives it effect on both paths**, and an unclassified action now requires a notice channel or fails closed.
- **RV-2.** Reversibility lives **only** in the signed bundle. There is no Context-Store raise, no runtime override, and no receipt field of record. Downgrading an action class from `IRREVERSIBLE` to `REVERSIBLE` is a policy change of the same severity as lowering a tier floor and **MUST** be subject to RK-5 (author and reviewer distinct from the proposer, offline signing key).
- **RV-3 (TR-8 applied to reversibility).** The Executor **MUST** recompute the reversibility class from the trusted bundle and the canonical Proposal's `task_type`, and **MUST NOT** read it from the receipt. *Rationale:* a receipt-asserted `REVERSIBLE` would suppress the DR-9 confirmation requirement exactly as v1.3.0's forged `risk_level_floor_only` suppressed attestation (X1). Same defect class, new field; enumerated here before it can be discovered later.
- **RV-4.** The recomputed class **MUST** be recorded in audit for every floor-HIGH decision, together with the release mode it selected and whether a human acknowledgement was received.
- **RK-2a (NEW in v1.3.4 — closes Z2).** Every expression in `risk_functions` **MUST** be expressible in the §8.3.1 grammar, and registry admission **MUST** reject any bundle containing an expression that is not. Through v1.3.3 the normative example above used `∩` and `≠ ∅` — set-intersection operators that appear nowhere in the §8.3.1 grammar — so the specification's own reference bundle was not admissible under the specification's own expression language. Named bundle `constants` (e.g. `SENSITIVE_PORTS`) resolve as `Set` literals at admission time and **MUST** be expanded before hashing, so that a constant table change is a bundle change under PB-4/RK-5.
- **RK-3.** Risk functions are monotone escalators: conditions may only raise the level. The final level is the maximum over all matched conditions, making rule interaction order-independent — mechanized as `Permutation_Invariance` (Annex B), which v1.2.0 asserted but did not prove.
- **RK-4.** The expression language is minimal: field references, comparisons, set membership, CIDR prefix arithmetic, tier ordering, boolean AND/OR. No loops, no user functions, no regex in conditions. It **MUST** be total and monotone, embedded via a verified evaluator (Cedar-style) or hand-rolled with mechanized proof.
- **RK-5.** Floors are part of the signed bundle and under two-person change control. **Lowering a floor (e.g. T3→T1) is the single most dangerous policy operation in the system** and **MUST** additionally require author and reviewer identities distinct from the party proposing the change. Raising a floor follows the ordinary path.
- **RK-5a.** RK-5's protection collapses to the security of the offline `policy_signing_key`. Two-person rule is procedural, not cryptographic. Deployments **SHOULD** protect the offline key in an HSM with M-of-N authorization.

### 8.3.2 The Floor/Raise Tier Model (NEW — Normative)

This section resolves v1.2.0's most serious defect: tier data lived in two mutually exclusive places (bundle `classifications.json` under RK-5, and Context Store `tier()` under §8.8), so RK-5's dual control protected a copy that did not feed evaluation, and a Context Store compromise could falsify tier *downward* to suppress escalation entirely.

- **TR-1.** Each resource has a **floor** tier from the signed bundle (`floors.json`), read-only to the runtime by PB-4.
- **TR-2.** The Context Store **MAY** serve a **raise** tier through `tier_raise(resource)`.
- **TR-3.** `effective_tier(r) = max(floor(r), raise(r))`. Absent raise = `T0`.
- **TR-4.** Because risk functions only escalate (RK-3), a compromised Context Store can drive effective tier **up** — producing more attestation, which is safe — and **can never** drive it below the signed floor. Mechanized as `FloorDominance` (Annex B).
- **TR-5.** **"HIGH-impact" is defined as: the risk level computed using `floor(r)` alone, ignoring all raises, is HIGH.** This value depends only on the signed bundle and the Proposal, so no single runtime component can forge it downward. INV-1-HIGH is stated over this definition.
- **TR-6.** The Decision **MUST** record both the floor-only risk and the effective risk. The Executor's HIGH checks (§9.3) key on floor-only risk, **recomputed per TR-8 — never read from the receipt.**
- **TR-8 (NEW in v1.3.1 — Normative).** **Any receipt field that determines whether attestation is required MUST be independently recomputed by the Executor from the signed bundle and the canonical Proposal. Such fields MUST NOT be trusted as transmitted.** This applies to `risk_level_floor_only` and `fidelity`.

  *Rationale.* v1.3.0 placed `risk_level_floor_only` in the receipt (§9.2) and keyed the Executor's quorum requirement on it (§9.3 step 7). Because the KMS signs the receipt, a **single compromised KMS** could emit a receipt for a genuinely floor-T3 action carrying `risk_level_floor_only: "LOW"` and an empty `attestations` array: signature valid, bundle hash and epoch genuine, nonce fresh, and step 7 not requiring quorum because the receipt asserted the action was not floor-HIGH. Step 9's Context recheck would not fire for the same reason. A floor-HIGH action would execute with no attestation under one compromised component — a violation of INV-1-HIGH.

  This was the same defect class as v1.2.0's tier suppression (C2): a security decision keyed on a value the attacker controls. The floor/raise model made tier unforgeable *at the Policy Engine*; v1.3.0 then let the Executor accept the derived risk on trust, relocating the flaw rather than eliminating it.

  The Executor already holds everything needed to recompute: it verifies `policy_bundle_hash` and `bundle_epoch` (§9.3 step 4), so it holds a trusted bundle containing `floors.json` and `risk_functions.json`, and it independently receives the canonical Proposal (B-1a). Recomputation requires no new data flow.

  The same reasoning applies to `fidelity`: a forged `F-HIGH` stamp would suppress the FC-2 confirmation requirement. Fidelity is adapter-stamped (B-6) and bound into the Decision; the Executor **MUST** verify it against the bundle-registered adapter binding for the `schema_id`, not accept the receipt's assertion.
- **TR-10 (NEW in v1.3.3; NORMATIVE in v1.3.4, generalizes TR-8).** TR-8 governs derived *values*; TR-10 governs derived *relations*. **Any claimed binding between two artifacts on which a control decision depends MUST be verified by the consumer from the signed bytes of both artifacts.** A transmitted identifier is a *name* for a binding, not *evidence* of one. The Y1 defect is TR-8's defect one level up: v1.3.1 stopped the Executor trusting a derived *risk value*, but left it trusting a derived *binding* (this signature belongs to this proposal). Implementers extending this specification MUST apply TR-10 to every receipt field that names a relationship, not only to every field that names a value.

- **TR-9.** Consequence, stated plainly: **lowering** a floor is an offline-key deploy under RK-5; **raising** effective tier remains fast via the Context Store. Deployments with volatile downward reclassification must accept deploy latency for that direction. Since downward reclassification is the dangerous direction, this is intended.

*Cost:* assumption A-7 (§2.3). The architecture guarantees no runtime component evaluates below the floor; it cannot know the floor was set honestly.

### 8.3.1 Formal Semantics of the Expression Language (Normative)

**Grammar**

```
Expr       ::= Term (("&&" | "||") Term)*
Term       ::= "(" Expr ")" | Comparison
Comparison ::= Value ("==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=") Value
             | Value "in" Set
             | Value ".prefixlen" "<=" Number
Value      ::= FieldRef | Literal | Number
FieldRef   ::= Identifier ("." Identifier)*
Literal    ::= String | TierLiteral
TierLiteral::= "T0" | "T1" | "T2" | "T3"
Set        ::= "[" Literal ("," Literal)* "]"
```

Static constraints, all of which are modelled in Annex B (v1.2.0 modelled only the second):

- Every FieldRef **MUST** resolve to a field declared in a typing environment derived from the Proposal schema and Context interface.
- Every Set **MUST** be non-empty and contain literals of homogeneous type.
- `.prefixlen` is valid only on fields typed as CIDR in that environment.
- Numeric literals are integers; see AC-1a for width.
- Values bound into the environment are integers or strings, and nothing else; see **EL-2**.

**Evaluation rules.** `⟦e⟧(P, Ctx) ∈ {true, false}`.

- **Field resolution:** absent path ⇒ `false` (totality).
- **Comparison:** standard over the values' types; type mismatch ⇒ `false`.
- **Set membership:** `true` iff equal by value to some element.
- **CIDR prefix:** `true` iff prefix length ≤ *n*.
- **Boolean connectives (REVISED):** `⟦e₁ && e₂⟧ = ⟦e₁⟧ ∧ ⟦e₂⟧`, `⟦e₁ || e₂⟧ = ⟦e₁⟧ ∨ ⟦e₂⟧`. **Evaluation order MUST NOT affect the result.** Short-circuit implementation is permitted.
- **EL-1 (NEW in v1.3.4 — Normative, closes Z1). Operator precedence and associativity.** `&&` binds **tighter** than `||`; both are **left-associative**. The grammar production above is therefore refined to:

```
Expr    ::= AndExpr ("||" AndExpr)*
AndExpr ::= Term ("&&" Term)*
```

  *Rationale.* As written through v1.3.3 the production placed `&&` and `||` at one level with no precedence and no associativity rule. Two implementers reading only the specification text produce different parse trees for any mixed expression: a literal left-to-right fold of the flat production yields `((a || b) && c)`, while the C-family default yields `(a || (b && c))`. A prose-derived differential run (`diff_prose.py`, 10,000 cases, two seeds) found **493 disagreements — 4.9%** — with the minimal witness `action != 'deny' || action == 'allow' && action == 'allow'` evaluating to `false` under one reading and `true` under the other.

  This is **not** covered by Annex B: those theorems quantify over an already-parsed `Expr` datatype, so the parser is outside the proof TCB (B.4). It is **not** covered by B.7 item 4 either: that harness generates well-formed triples as ASTs, never as source text, so it cannot observe a parse divergence. Z1 lives precisely in the model↔production gap.

  *Consequences the rule closes.* (a) A Policy Engine and an Executor built independently from this text can compute different floor-only risk for the same bundle; §9.3 step 7a then fires a **critical alert indistinguishable from KMS compromise** (P-5 names this exact confusion as the thing the differential suite must prevent). Safety is preserved — the disagreement fails closed — but the alert channel is poisoned. (b) More seriously, where both evaluators share one parser, no disagreement is observable at all and the *bundle author's* intent silently diverges from the evaluated meaning: a rule intended as `(X && Y) || Z` grading an action HIGH may evaluate as `X && (Y || Z)` and grade it MEDIUM. Nothing in the pipeline detects that; it is an A-7-class governance defect enabled by an ambiguous normative grammar.

  Bundle authoring tools **SHOULD** emit fully parenthesized expressions regardless, and registry admission **SHOULD** warn on any mixed-connective expression lacking explicit parentheses.

- **EL-2 (NEW in v1.3.17 — Normative, closes ACP-74). The value domain of the evaluation environment.** A value bound into the evaluation environment from a Proposal parameter **MUST** be an **integer** or a **string**. A Proposal supplying a parameter of any other JSON type — a non-integer number, a boolean, `null`, an array, an object, or an integer outside the width the deployment declares under AC-1a — **MUST** cause the Proposal to be **refused** under this clause. An implementation **MUST NOT** re-type such a value, coerce it, or bind it under a type it does not have.

  *Rationale.* Through v1.3.15 this section typed the *expression* and left the *environment* untyped. It said numeric literals are integers, and it said every FieldRef must resolve to a field declared in a typing environment derived from the Proposal schema — but it never said what an implementation owes a Proposal that supplies a value outside that domain, and "resolve to a declared field" is a statement about the *name*, not about the *value that arrives under it*.

  Both reference implementations filled the gap the same way and one of them filled it wrongly. The Python reference typed each parameter with a two-way test — integer, else string — which has no third arm, so a JSON `22.0` bound as a **string**. A string never compares equal to a number (type mismatch ⇒ `false`, above), so **every comparison mentioning that parameter silently evaluated false**, and a `raise_to` clause that cannot fire cannot raise. Against this document's own reference bundle, `port: 22` graded HIGH and was held for a two-person quorum while **`port: 22.0` graded MEDIUM and executed with no attestation at all**. RFC 8259 has one number type: `22` and `22.0` denote the same number, and the Proposal is authored by the party under verification, so the spelling is adversary-chosen. This is the §8.4 grading fold — the recomputation TR-8 exists to make independent — being steered by a value the recomputation was handed.

  The bug is not that the domain was violated. It is that a **value outside the domain took the permissive branch instead of a refusal**, which is P-4's rule (unknown is never LOW) arriving one layer below where P-4 is written. The same reading disposes of the other arms: a boolean is not a number even where the implementation language says it is — `isinstance(True, int)` is `True` in Python, so a JSON `true` compared equal to `1` in one implementation and was refused by the other, an accident of one type system deciding a control outcome — and an integer too wide to represent must refuse rather than wrap, because a wrapped threshold compares *smaller* than the policy author wrote.

  **Refusal, not coercion.** Reading `22.0` back to `22` looks like the helpful repair and is a second definition of a number: it leaves `22.5` with no home, and it decides on the author's behalf which of two spellings was meant. A deployment that wants non-integral quantities must declare them in the Proposal schema as strings with an explicit comparison, or extend this grammar in a revision that says what ordering it induces.

> **Retired claim.** v1.2.0 prohibited short-circuit evaluation "because it leaks timing." That prohibition was contradicted by its own Dafny artifact (which used short-circuit `&&`/`||`), and the stated conformance method — value-equivalent differential testing — could not have detected a violation anyway, since short-circuit and full evaluation return identical booleans. Timing side channels in policy evaluation are now explicitly out of scope (§4.2). Deployments requiring data-oblivious evaluation must specify it separately; the guarantee this document makes is *result-order-independence*, which is what soundness actually requires and which Annex B proves.

**Conformance:** implementations **MUST** provide the mechanized proof as part of the conformance report. The model-level proof is executed (§1.1); the deployment-level obligation is re-execution against the shipped artifact hash plus the differential binding of both production evaluators (B.7 item 4).

### 8.4 Evaluation Order (Normative)

```
 1. Schema attestation      — valid (schema_id, version, hash) in bundle   → else DENY
 2. Fidelity admission      — adapter class permitted for this task_type   → else DENY
 3. Action rule lookup      — a rule exists for task_type                  → else DENY
 4. Identity & capability   — operator holds every required capability     → else DENY
 5. Scope constraints       — domains, tenancy, target set membership      → else DENY
 6. Segregation of duties   — operator ∉ excluded roles; operator ≠ auditor→ else DENY
 7. Tier resolution         — effective_tier = max(floor, raise); also
                              compute floor-only risk (§8.3.2 TR-5)
 8. Risk computation        — §8.3; produces LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
 9. Accumulator evaluation  — §8.5; may raise risk or DENY outright
10. Temporal constraints    — change windows by (action, tier, risk)       → else DENY
11. Disposition             — LOW    → ALLOW, unless confirmation required
                              MEDIUM → ALLOW iff rule.allow_medium and no
                                       confirmation required, else ATTEST
                              HIGH   → ATTEST (never auto-ALLOW)
                              F-LOW and effective_tier ≥ T2 → ATTEST
12. Attester eligibility    — (ATTEST only) eligible pool non-empty and
                              disjoint from operator for approvals         → else DENY
13. Receipt issuance        — §9
```

- **EO-1.** HIGH **MUST NOT** be auto-allowed by any configuration. There is no flag that makes step 11 emit ALLOW for HIGH.
- **EO-2 (REVISED in v1.3.10 — the latency budget is per risk class).** Steps 1–12 target **< 10 ms p99** excluding Context round-trips. End-to-end warm: **< 25 ms p99 for LOW and MEDIUM** decisions; **< 250 ms p99 for floor-HIGH** decisions.

  *Rationale, and why this is not a relaxation.* v1.3.9 measured the floor-HIGH path under the CR-6 hybrid floor at **p99 = 40.7 ms for signature verification alone** (one receipt plus three attestation signatures, real Ed25519 and real ML-DSA-65), against a 25 ms end-to-end budget: two normative requirements, jointly unsatisfiable. The resolution is not to weaken either but to observe that **the 25 ms bound was written for the wrong path**. A floor-HIGH action has already waited for a human quorum to read and approve it, and DR-1 then holds it a further 60 s before release. Optimising 15 ms of verification on a path containing minutes of deliberate human latency is a category error. The 25 ms bound is correct and retained where it matters: the hot path of LOW/MEDIUM decisions that pass without human involvement, whose receipts live 120 s and whose signatures verify in well under a millisecond.

  **No security property is weakened.** Hybrid suites remain mandatory on every path including LOW and MEDIUM (CR-6). Only the latency budget is differentiated, by the same risk class that already differentiates attestation, deferred release, and acknowledgement.

  *Implementation requirement.* The measurement used `dilithium-py`, a pure-Python reference implementation; native ML-DSA (liboqs, AWS-LC) verifies roughly two orders of magnitude faster. Deployments **MUST NOT** ship a reference implementation of a signature primitive in production, independently of whether it meets the budget, and **MUST** publish their own measurement against the class-appropriate bound. The **53× increase in signature bytes on the wire** (13.2 kB vs 256 B for a floor-HIGH receipt) is **algorithm-bound**, does not improve with a faster library, and **MUST** be sized for in transport and storage.

### 8.5 Session Accumulators

```json
{
  "accumulators": [
    {"key": "privilege_grants",        "group_by": ["operator"],          "window": "1h",  "threshold": 5,    "effect": "raise_risk_to:HIGH"},
    {"key": "firewall_allow_breadth",  "group_by": ["operator","session"],"window": "24h", "metric": "sum(2^(32-prefixlen))", "threshold": 65536, "effect": "raise_risk_to:HIGH"},
    {"key": "distinct_T2_resources",   "group_by": ["operator"],          "window": "1h",  "threshold": 10,   "effect": "raise_risk_to:HIGH"},
    {"key": "schema_rejections",       "group_by": ["operator","source"], "window": "10m", "threshold": 20,   "effect": "deny"},
    {"key": "output_validation_fails", "group_by": ["tenant"],            "window": "10m", "threshold": 10,   "effect": "flag"},
    {"key": "batch_input_total",       "group_by": ["operator"],          "window": "24h", "threshold": 1000, "effect": "raise_risk_to:MEDIUM"}
  ]
}
```

- **AC-1.** Accumulators are declared in the bundle: key, grouping, window, threshold, effect.
- **AC-1a (REVISED).** Accumulator metrics **MUST** be computed over arbitrary-precision integers with deterministic semantics. v1.2.0 permitted 64-bit with an "or arbitrary-precision" fallback and asserted a ≤10⁶-term bound that no normative limit enforced (L-05 bounds items *per request*; windows run to 30 days). Arbitrary precision removes the precondition entirely. Fixed-width implementations are permitted only if the deployment proves its own term bound in the conformance report.
- **AC-2.** Accumulator updates are atomic with Decision commit and audit write under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation or equivalent. Inconsistencies are reconciled within 60 s (§11.3). Audit record and accumulator update share a transaction ID.
- **AC-3.** Accumulator state is part of Context (P-1); the snapshot consumed is captured in audit, so replay is exact.
- **AC-4.** Accumulator effects are monotone (RK-3 applies).
- **AC-5 (NEW in v1.3.10 — Normative, closes W1). Accumulators count executions, not decisions.** An increment **MUST** be committed at **release** (§9.6), not at Decision commit. A Decision that is repudiated (DR-4), times out unacknowledged (DR-9), or fails closed at any Executor step **MUST NOT** increment any accumulator. A DS-3 re-drive of one logical action **MUST** increment at most once, keyed on the DS-6 `action_id`.

  *Rationale (W1).* AC-2 bound accumulator updates to Decision commit, correct before v1.3.6 because a committed Decision executed immediately. Deferred release breaks that identity: an action can be decided and never execute. Counting at decision time inflates counters with actions that never happened, and the inflation is **attacker-controllable** — a party able to trigger proposals attributed to a victim operator, each subsequently repudiated, drives that operator's counters over threshold. Where the effect is `deny` (e.g. `schema_rejections`) the result is a targeted denial of service against a legitimate operator, mounted entirely through actions the system correctly refused. Note the shape: the defect was introduced by the DR-*machinery and lived in a section DR-* never mentions.

  *Bounded, stated for completeness:* evasion in the opposite direction — splitting activity across identities to stay under a threshold — **cannot** suppress floor-HIGH attestation, because floor-only risk (TR-5) is computed from the signed bundle alone and ignores accumulator raises entirely. Floor dominance caps this residual as it caps Context Store compromise.

### 8.6 Attestation Protocol (Unified — replaces v1.2.0 §8.6 and DB-1)

Confirmations and approvals are the same object with different attester constraints. This unification is what removes v1.2.0's inversion, in which free-text ingress had a mandatory intent check and structured ingress had none.

- **AT-1 (REVISED in v1.3.4 — closes Y4; AMENDED in v1.3.31 — ACP-299).** ATTEST creates an **Attestation Object** binding: **`alg`** (the signature suite this attestation was raised under: a machine suite registered in the signed bundle under CR-1, or one of HM-4's two WebAuthn key types for a `webauthn` entry, which CR-8 places outside the CR-4 floor), `proposal_hash`, `policy_bundle_hash`, `bundle_epoch`, `context_snapshot_hash`, floor-only risk, required attester roles and counts, **`operator`**, `expires_at` (the issue instant plus the bundle's `attestation_window_seconds`, PB-13; ≤ 60 min, L-15), and a unique **`attestation_id`** = SHA-256 over the canonical CBOR encoding (AT-8a) of those fields plus a 128-bit fresh attestation nonce. `operator` is included so that approver-distinctness (AT-2) and the step-9 capability recheck key on a **signature-covered** value rather than a receipt-body claim; mechanized as `Y4_OperatorTamperDetected` (Annex D).
- **AT-2.** Two kinds:
  - **Confirmation** — first-party. The *operator* re-affirms the canonical Proposal. Required when policy demands it, and **MUST** be required for F-LOW at effective tier ≥ T2. Closes the semantic gap between "what was meant" and "what was proposed."
  - **Approval** — second-party. Attesters **MUST** be distinct from the operator and mutually distinct — for human attesters, distinct credentials (HM-5). Quorum ≥ 2 for floor-HIGH.
- **AT-3.** Attesters **MUST** be shown the canonical Proposal rendered by fixed template (§7.3): full parameter list, **floor tiers and the bundle `rule_id`s that raised the risk** (not Context-asserted values — see A-8), computed risk, fidelity class, the operator's accumulator standing, and the `proposal_hash` being signed. Attesters sign a *hash-identified Proposal*, never a paraphrase.
- **AT-4.** On quorum, the engine **re-runs steps 1–10** against *current* Context before receipt issuance. If capability, floor, raise, accumulator, or bundle state changed such that the Decision would differ, the attestation is void and the Proposal returns to disposition.
- **AT-5.** Expired attestations are void. Partial quorum at expiry is void. **Attestation objects are single-use, enforced by ledger consumption of `attestation_id` (§9.3.1) — not by assertion.** v1.2.0 stated single-use as a property with no enforcing mechanism, permitting attestation amplification (T-14).
- **AT-6.** Deployments **SHOULD** monitor attestation latency and rate per attester. A sustained approval rate above ~95% with sub-minute median latency is the signature of rubber-stamping and **SHOULD** trigger review of which actions genuinely require attestation. A quorum that always says yes is a control that has already failed.
- **AT-7.** **Behavioral assumption warning.** INV-1-HIGH depends on attesters maintaining discriminative review. If attesters converge to rubber-stamping, the mechanical guarantee becomes a behavioral fiction. There is no mechanical fallback; operational monitoring and human governance are the only countermeasures.
- **AT-8 (NEW in v1.3.3; NORMATIVE in v1.3.4, closes Y1; AMENDED in v1.3.20 by AB-1).** The receipt **MUST** commit to each full **Attestation Object** — under receipt version 3 the entries travel alongside the receipt and are bound by the entry digest of §8.6b AB-1, rather than being contained in the signed body. Either way the Executor **MUST** obtain — all AT-1 fields, including the 128-bit attestation nonce and the object's own `expires_at` — not merely its `attestation_id`. The attester signature is over the canonical encoding of that object. Rationale: the Executor cannot verify that a signature is *bound to the executed proposal* unless it can reconstruct the signed bytes. Transmitting only the id (v1.3.2) reduced binding verification to a claim the KMS asserts and the Executor cannot check — a receipt bearing a genuine quorum raised for proposal P₁ verifies against an attacker-chosen P₂ under one compromised KMS. Mechanized in Annex D (`Y1_CurrentCheckAcceptsMisbinding` shows the v1.3.2 check accepts the misbinding; `Y1_AttackBlocked_Generalized` shows AT-8 rejects it against an attacker holding arbitrarily many observed signatures).
- **AT-8a (NEW in v1.3.4 — Normative, closes Y5.2 on the binding path).** The Attestation Object **MUST** be canonicalized as **canonical CBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2)** for both signing and `attestation_id` derivation — the same canonicalization as the receipt (WE-1/2). JCS (RFC 8785) **MUST NOT** be used for the Attestation Object. Rationale: AT-8 moved object hashing onto the binding path, where the id the ledger consumes is now `SHA-256(canonical(obj))`. Any encoder disagreement between issuer and Executor becomes a freshness and single-use defect in the exact mechanism Y1b closes — two encoders means two ids for one object, so a re-encoded object claims a fresh ledger slot. The dual-canonicalization observation was filed as an informative minor in ACP-AUDIT-001 (Y5.2); AT-8 promotes it to a binding-path requirement. Implementations **MUST** reject any Attestation Object whose received encoding is not the canonical one (non-canonical encodings **MUST NOT** be re-serialized and accepted).
- **AT-9 (NEW in v1.3.15 — Normative). The quorum threshold is RECOMPUTED from the signed bundle, never read from an attestation.** The number of distinct approvals required for a floor-HIGH action **MUST** be taken from `quorum_k` (PB-6). The Attestation Object's `required_count` **MUST NOT** be an input to that decision, in whole or in part, under any circumstance — including the case where every entry agrees on it.

  Separately and **additionally**, every Attestation Object presented **MUST** carry a `required_count` equal to `quorum_k`, and a mismatch **MUST** fail closed with a critical alert. These are two requirements with two purposes and neither substitutes for the other:

  - The **first** is the security requirement. `required_count` is signed by the attester, and an attester is exactly the party under verification, so a verifier reading the threshold from it asks the adversary how large a quorum to demand. Under the §14 suite-12 classification the threshold is class **R**; there is no reading of the method under which it may be **T**.
  - The **second** is a **consent** requirement and belongs to AT-3, not to INV-1-HIGH. `required_count` is part of what the attester was shown and signed, so a mismatch means the humans approved under a policy the engine did not apply. An attester shown "3 approvals required" who signs on that basis has consented to an action three people would review; executing it after two is a real loss of the basis their signature rested on, even though the count enforced was the bundle's and the invariant held throughout. **Do not collapse the second into the first.** They fail closed on disjoint inputs, and an implementation that keeps only the first satisfies INV-1-HIGH while silently executing actions no attester agreed to.

  *Rationale.* This clause exists because its absence was exploited. See the v1.3.15 alert in §1 (a).
- **AT-10 (NEW in v1.3.21 — Normative). Every attestation counted toward a quorum clears a signed assurance floor, recomputed from the registry.** The attester registry (§8.2 `attesters/`) **MAY** record, per enrolled identity, the authenticator **assurance level** its key was enrolled at, over the ordered ladder **AS0 < AS1 < AS2** (software key · multi-factor-protected key · hardware-bound key; the schema states the SP 800-63B correspondence), and **MAY** record a registry-wide floor `min_attester_assurance`. An identity with no recorded level **MUST** be read as **AS0**, and an absent floor **MUST** be read as **AS0** — the two defaults point in opposite directions and each is the safe one for what it defaults: an entry's level is a *claim*, so its default understates and can only cause refusals, while the floor is *policy*, so its permissive default is disclosed on the same terms as `quorum_k = 1` (PB-6) rather than silently invalidating every registry written before the field existed. At §9.3 step 7b the Executor **MUST** refuse, with a critical alert naming this clause, any attestation entry whose identity's recorded level does not satisfy the floor — approvals and confirmations alike, before the entry contributes to any count. The comparison is **recomputed from the signed bundle on both sides** (TR-8): neither the level nor the floor may be read from a receipt, an Attestation Object, or any enrolment service consulted at decision time. *(v1.3.30)* For a `webauthn` entry the level is **derived at enrolment from the authenticator** (HM-1: a platform passkey with user verification is AS1, a roaming hardware key is AS2) and an entry recorded at AS0, or with no recorded level, is an invalid bundle — the AS0 default above is for a key file, and a human leg is never one.

  *Why this clause exists, and what found the gap.* Every prior clause about approval is a clause about a **signature**, and a signature says only that a key was used. AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, AT-8/AT-8a/AT-8b and PB-7 together did not say one word about how an attester's key is held or how the human is authenticated to it — a private key in a configuration file on a shared build host satisfied all of them, and a second implementation could hold keys that way and be conformant, because there was no clause to violate. The whole Door A argument is *a human authorised this*; the link between "the key signed" and "the human decided" was asserted nowhere. Found by the control-mapping annex's SP 800-63B row (ACP-122): EU AI Act Art. 14(5) requires verification by two *natural persons*, and two keys is not two people.

  *What this clause does not establish, stated so it is not read wider than it is.* The recorded level is a **label written at enrolment**, and no runtime mechanism decides whether the label matches the world — whether the key is *really* hardware-bound is established by humans at enrolment, and a wrong label here is exactly **A-7**'s shape: conceded unprovable, mitigated by enrolment being a two-person offline-key operation on the signed registry (RK-5's discipline), not solved. Device posture is a separate, undecided question and this clause deliberately says nothing about it. And one covered-looking path is **not covered, disclosed rather than implied**: the release-time acknowledgement (DR-9, ACK-1..6) verifies the acknowledger's signature against the same registry but applies **no assurance floor** — a confirmer whose key would be refused at step 7b is accepted at release. Closing it is the same one comparison in `acp_ack`'s verify path; it is left open here because this clause was cut at step 7b and a silent scope extension is how a clause acquires an enforcement point nobody reviewed. The floor an entry is compared against is chain-ordered like §4's custody tiers and unlike CR-4's suites, which are sets; a future level that does not totally order against AS0–AS2 must not be forced into this ladder.
- **AT-8b (NEW in v1.3.5 — Normative, closes Z4). The Attestation Object schema is CLOSED.** Every AT-1 field is **REQUIRED**; there are no optional fields, no defaultable fields, and no extension points. An object carrying an unknown field, or omitting any AT-1 field, **MUST** be rejected — never normalized, never defaulted. *Rationale (Z4).* AT-8a pinned the canonicalizer but not the schema. Given any optional field, an object present-as-null and the same object with the field omitted are **each** canonical CBOR, hash to **two distinct ids**, and therefore claim **two ledger slots** — one attestation, consumed twice. T-14 attestation amplification reopens through the very mechanism Y1b closed. Canonicalization rules cannot fix this: the ambiguity is in the field set, not the encoding, so the fix must be schema-level. Mechanized as `Z4_OptionalFieldYieldsTwoIds`. Extending the Attestation Object in a future revision is therefore a **breaking** change requiring a `receipt_version` increment, never an additive one.

#### 8.6b Digest-bound attestations — receipt version 3 (NEW in v1.3.20 — Normative, AB-*)

**Why this exists.** AT-8 requires the receipt to carry each full Attestation Object, and that requirement is correct about *binding* and fatal to *custody*. Each entry carries a hybrid signature whose ML-DSA-65 half is 3,309 bytes, hex-encoded to 6,618 characters; a floor-HIGH receipt with the DR-9 operator confirmation measures **22,161 bytes**. AWS KMS caps `ED25519_SHA_512` with `MessageType: RAW` at **4,096 bytes**, and pure Ed25519 admits no prehash that preserves RFC 8032 compatibility — `M` enters the signing computation twice, at `r = H(prefix ‖ M)` and again at `k = H(R ‖ A ‖ M)`, which is precisely why RFC 8032 defines Ed25519ph as a *separate algorithm*. The ML-DSA half is unblocked at any size through `EXTERNAL_MU`; **Ed25519 is the entire remaining constraint.** Every vendor claim in this paragraph was executed, not read: `tools/kms-compat-2026-08-22.json`, 5/5 PASS, 2026-08-22. The format this section defines has since been executed end to end: `tools/kms-compat-2026-08-24.json` (6/6 PASS, 2026-08-24) records a version-3 receipt — 629-byte signed body, the full floor-HIGH quorum bound beside it — signed by real KMS keys, both primitives as `MessageType: RAW`, and verified out-of-band by both implementations; the transcript carries the raw public keys, signed bytes and signatures, so the receipt re-verifies with no vendor account. **That last clause is true of 2026-08-24 and is not true today, and the distinction is the point of dating the evidence.** The transcript's receipt carries a bare `"nonce": "nonce-1"`; once WE-4 and L-17 were enforced on the receipt nonce at §9.3 step 6, both implementations refuse it before the ledger claim. What re-verifies with no vendor account is the *signature*, which is what the committed test checks; the end-to-end §9.3 acceptance is a claim about the day it was made. The transcript was not edited to preserve it — a transcript amended to stay true stops being evidence — and a re-run under the current rule needs the vendor account again.

The consequence is not a performance note. A receipt that cannot be signed by a key held at custody tier T2 or above means the receipt signing key **must** live in application memory, and §4's custody tiers become unreachable for the one key whose compromise INV-1-HIGH is stated against.

- **AB-0 (Normative). Receipt version 3, and no compatibility window.** A conformant Executor **MUST** verify `receipt_version == 3` before any other check, and **MUST** reject every other value, including its absence. Implementations **MUST NOT** accept version 2 and version 3 concurrently. *Rationale.* Version 2 is the weaker representation: a verifier accepting both lets an attacker present version 2 and never face the digest binding at all. A transition window is therefore not a migration aid, it is a downgrade path — the CR-4 shape one layer up, where the format rather than the suite is negotiated by the party under verification. The number is 3 and not 2 because §9.2's published example already carries `"receipt_version": 2` for the containment form; reusing it would give one version two meanings.

- **AB-1 (Normative). The commitment is a digest over the whole attestation ENTRY.** The receipt body **MUST** carry `attestation_digests`, an array of `sha256:`-prefixed digests, one per attestation. Each digest **MUST** be computed over the canonical encoding of the complete entry — `obj`, `kind`, `attester` and `sig` — and **MUST NOT** be `attestation_id`, nor any digest whose preimage is the Attestation Object alone. The entries themselves **MUST** travel alongside the receipt and **MUST NOT** appear in the signed body. For every received entry the Executor **MUST** recompute the digest from the received bytes and **MUST** verify its presence in the signed list before verifying the attester signature.

  *Rationale, and this is the trap.* `AT1_FIELDS` is closed over the **object**: it contains no `kind`, no `attester` and no `sig`. Quorum composition is decided from the **entry** — `kind` selects approval or confirmation, `attester` supplies the identity distinctness is counted over — and the attester signs neither of them (ACP-80). Under version 2 both were sealed by containment inside the signed receipt. Move the attestations out and commit only to the object, which is the obvious implementation because `attestation_id` already exists and is already normative, and an attacker on the transport path flips one entry's `kind` from `confirmation` to `approval` while **every digest still matches**. Verified rather than argued: with an object-scoped digest, conformance case `a_AB1_kind_flipped` executes to completion.

  **Two identifiers now exist and MUST NOT be merged.** `attestation_id` remains `SHA-256` over the canonical Attestation Object and keeps its job — ledger consumption under CL-3, because the same object replayed inside a different entry is still a replay. The entry digest is the receipt's commitment to the exact bytes it authorised. They answer different questions, and a later simplification that collapses them reopens the hole above.

- **AB-2 (Normative). One canonical ordering.** `attestation_digests` **MUST** be sorted in strictly ascending lexicographic order over the UTF-8 bytes of the digest strings, including the `sha256:` prefix, and an Executor **MUST** reject a list that is not. *Rationale.* Without a declared order the same quorum yields two canonical encodings of one receipt, hence two receipt identities — the Z4 encoding split reached with no optional field involved.

- **AB-3 (Normative). Duplicate digests are refused explicitly.** `attestation_digests` **MUST NOT** contain repeated values, and the check **MUST** be made at this layer rather than delegated to CL-3's `attestation_id` claim. *Rationale.* CL-3 is object-scoped and requires a Consumption Ledger. A stateless verifier — `acp-decision` holds exactly the stateless half of the §9.3 checklist — has no ledger for CL-3 to fire in, and there this clause is the only defence. In an Executor that does hold a ledger this check is masked by CL-3 and kills no mutant; that is recorded as a **positive-path obligation** in `dossier/05-TEST-EVIDENCE.md` rather than presented as a control, because scoping a rule to the one implementation that happens to carry the masking component is how a gap is created.

- **AB-4 (Normative). Cardinality, in both directions.** The number of attestation entries received **MUST** equal `len(attestation_digests)`. Fewer is withholding, more is injection, and both **MUST** fail closed. Quorum **MUST** be counted from verified attestations and **MUST NOT** be derived from the length of the signed list. *Rationale.* Membership alone permits an attacker to withhold entries: every digest presented still matches, the quorum silently shrinks, and no check fires. Counting from `len(attestation_digests)` instead would be reading the size of the quorum off the receipt, which is AT-3's defect one layer down.

- **AB-5 (Normative). The signed body excludes the entries.** The bytes covered by the receipt signature are the canonical encoding of the receipt body **without** the attestation entries. The entries are carried in the same transport envelope and are bound solely by AB-1.

  *What this costs, stated plainly.* Digest binding is **not** cryptographically stronger than containment: given the entry-scoped preimage of AB-1 and a collision-resistant hash, the two are equivalent for integrity. What changes is shape — the binding moves from "these bytes are inside what I signed" to "I signed a commitment to these exact bytes, and the verifier recomputes it", which is the RES-9 form. And it is **weaker in one specific way that has to be paid for**: containment cannot be forgotten, membership can. Under version 2 a verifier that ignored the attestation list still had those bytes covered by the receipt signature; under version 3 a verifier that skips AB-1 has *no* binding at all. The obligation moves out of the format and into the verifier, which is why AB-1, AB-2, AB-4 and AB-6 each carry a conformance case and a mutant rather than a sentence.

- **AB-6 (Normative). The signed body MUST NOT exceed 4,096 bytes.** An Executor **MUST** reject a receipt whose canonical signed body is larger, and it **MUST** check this on the measured bytes rather than on any proxy such as an entry count. *Rationale.* A receipt exceeding this bound could not have been produced by a holder at custody tier T2 or above, so accepting one is accepting a receipt that only a software-held key could have signed — a custody downgrade, admitted silently. The rule is on bytes because the first draft of it capped the digest **count** at 50, chosen from the measured crossing point, and the body at that cap measured **4,107 bytes** — past the very limit the cap existed to respect. An entry count is a proxy whose accuracy depends on the length of every other field, so a deployment with longer `tenant_id` or `operator` values satisfies the stated rule while breaching the real one.

*Measured outcome.* The floor-HIGH quorum that was 22,161 bytes under version 2 has a signed body of **629 bytes** under version 3, with the 21,782 bytes of attestations still bound. Asserted by a command — `t_receipt_fits_the_custody_limit` in conformance suite 1 — and not by this paragraph.

### 8.6a Attestation Queue Isolation (NEW — Normative)

Numerous controls cap Decisions at ATTEST when tripped (RAD-2, §8.7.1 anomaly detection, AU-6 anchoring loss, §12.5 NTS loss, PB-1 expiry grace). An adversary who can cheaply trip any of them floods the human queue, and AT-7's rubber-stamping failure follows. v1.2.0 scoped DoS out and never discussed this composition, even though every link in it was specified.

- **AQ-1.** Attestation queues **MUST** be partitioned by floor-only risk. Floor-HIGH items **MUST NOT** share a queue with items escalated only by a fail-closed cap.
- **AQ-2.** When a fail-closed cap is active, items escalated *solely* by that cap **MUST** be marked `cap_escalated` and **MUST** be rate-limited into the queue.
- **AQ-3.** Queue depth and arrival rate per attester **MUST** be monitored; depth beyond a configured bound is a critical alert, not a silent backlog.

#### 8.6c Human attesters (NEW in v1.3.30 — Normative, HM-*, ACP-288)

Every clause above is about a signature, and through v1.3.29 the only signature the registry could hold for a person was a hybrid key pair — an Ed25519 key **and** an ML-DSA-65 key. No passkey, platform authenticator or hardware security key produces an ML-DSA-65 signature, so the only human an implementation could enrol was a software key file, which AT-10 rates AS0 and whose holder Art. 14(5) does not call a natural person. This section admits the mechanism every current high-assurance approval product uses — a WebAuthn assertion from a credential the person enrolled on their own authenticator — and states, rather than hides, what it costs (HM-6, CR-8).

- **HM-1. A human attester is a `webauthn` registry entry.** An entry in `attesters/` carries `kind`, and `kind: "webauthn"` names a human: `role`, `rp_id` (the approval origin's host), `credential_id`, `public_key` (the COSE_Key the authenticator returned at registration), and `alg` ∈ {`webauthn-es256`, `webauthn-ed25519`}. It is produced by a WebAuthn **registration ceremony** in which user verification was **required** and attestation was **requested**, and the level recorded for it under AT-10 is **derived from the authenticator's attestation** — a platform authenticator with user verification is AS1, a roaming hardware authenticator is AS2 — never claimed by the enrolling service or the person. A `webauthn` entry recorded at AS0, or with no recorded level, is an invalid bundle under PB-1: a human leg without user verification is possession, not a person. `kind: "hybrid"` names a machine attester in the shape every registry had before v1.3.30; an entry with no `kind` is refused (`Malformed`), because a key kind guessed from which fields are present is the guess a tagged union exists to refuse.
- **HM-2. A human signs the bytes a machine signs.** The message under a human assertion is the UTF-8 bytes of the **recomputed** `attestation_id` (§9.3 step 7b(v)) for an approval or confirmation, and of the recomputed acknowledgement id `h(obj)` for a DR-9 acknowledgement. It is carried as the WebAuthn challenge — base64url without padding in `clientDataJSON.challenge` — and the verifier **recomputes** it and compares; it never reads the challenge as a value (RES-8).
- **HM-3. The assertion is the entry's one signature primitive.** For a `webauthn` entry the entry's `sig` map (CR-2) carries exactly one primitive, `webauthn`, whose value is `b64:` (WE-4) of the canonical CBOR (AT-8a) of the map `{"authenticator_data", "client_data_json", "signature"}`, each a byte string. `obj.alg` **MUST** equal the registry entry's `alg`; a mismatch is refused under this clause before any byte of the assertion is examined, because `alg` is signature-covered (CR-5) and the registry, not the object, says what kind of key this identity holds.
- **HM-4. Verification, in this order, every failure a refusal and a critical alert naming this clause.** (a) `client_data_json` parses as JSON and its `type` is `webauthn.get`; (b) its `challenge` equals HM-2's message, base64url; (c) its `origin` is exactly `https://` followed by the entry's `rp_id` and nothing else — an assertion made for another origin is an assertion made on another site, which is the phishing case this binding exists to refuse; (d) `authenticator_data` is at least 37 bytes, its first 32 equal SHA-256 of `rp_id`, and its flags byte has **UP** (bit 0) and **UV** (bit 2) set; (e) `signature` verifies under the entry's `public_key` over `authenticator_data || SHA-256(client_data_json)` — for `webauthn-es256`, ECDSA over secp256r1 with SHA-256, DER-encoded; for `webauthn-ed25519`, RFC 8032 under ACP-106's strict rule; (f) the 32-bit **signature counter** in `authenticator_data` is claimed in the Consumption Ledger under `(tenant_id, webauthn_counter, credential_id)` and **MUST** be strictly greater than the stored value whenever either is non-zero — a regression is a cloned authenticator and is a critical alert, not a retry. No step is skipped for a smaller check that already failed: the first failure in this order is the refusal, on both sides of the differential.
- **HM-5. Distinctness and weak keys.** PB-7 applies to `webauthn` entries over `public_key`: two identities with one credential are one holder. PB-9 applies to a `webauthn-ed25519` credential; an ES256 `public_key` that is not a point on secp256r1 is refused at load as `RegistryKeyWeak`.
- **HM-6. A human leg is classical, and this document says so.** No authenticator in existence signs with a post-quantum primitive. A human assertion counts toward the quorum under its own `alg`, outside the suite floor (CR-8), and the **post-quantum binding of a human's decision is the receipt and the anchor**: AB-1 digests the whole entry — assertion bytes included — into the receipt body that RK-5's hybrid key signs at the moment of the decision, and §11 anchors it. A future adversary who can forge the classical assertion cannot alter what was bound and anchored then. A verifier **MUST NOT** treat a human assertion as a post-quantum signature, and a deployment's residual risk statement **MUST** carry the sentence (§15).
- **HM-7. Freshness is by construction, not by a timestamp read from the assertion.** The challenge is an id claimed single-use in the ledger (7b(v); for an acknowledgement, the reference's single-use rule) and valid only inside the attestation window the bundle declares (L-15, PB-13). The assertion carries no time and none is read from it.

*Why WebAuthn and not a mobile application, a key file or a chat button.* A key file is AS0 and was refused on 2026-09-07. A chat or email button proves a session, not a person with an authenticator (ACP-122). A dedicated application would hold its key in the same secure element a passkey does, with more code, an app-store dependency and nothing gained. WebAuthn is the mechanism SP 800-63B's AAL2 and AAL3 name, every major identity provider ships, and every phone and laptop already carries; the assurance ladder AT-10 defined in v1.3.21 maps onto it one to one. What it cannot give is a post-quantum human signature, and HM-6 is where that is written down instead of wished away.

### 8.7 Context Store Integrity

The engine's Decisions are only as truthful as its Context. For live-directory-sync deployments, capability data **MUST** be sourced from the authoritative IdP/IGA via authenticated sync with staleness ≤ 5 min for revocations (push preferred). Static-entitlement and attestation providers **MUST** satisfy their own freshness contracts (§8.8). Context reads are snapshot-consistent. A Context Store unreachable or beyond staleness bounds fails closed. All Context mutations are audited. The Context Store **MUST NOT** be writable by the Executor, the model path, or any ingress component.

**Note:** under §8.3.2, Context Store compromise can no longer suppress escalation. It remains able to *withhold* capability facts (causing DENY — safe) or *raise* tier (causing more attestation — safe), and to falsify capability *grants* for MEDIUM, which is INV-1-MEDIUM's disclosed residual.

### 8.7.1 Context Store Hardening (Informative)

- Context Store signing key **SHOULD** be in an offline HSM.
- The Policy Engine **SHOULD** read from a read-only replica with ≤ 5 min replication lag.
- **Mandatory anomaly detection** on capability deltas: >5% of tenant population changed in one sync triggers a critical alert and caps new Decisions at ATTEST pending review, subject to AQ-2.

### 8.8 Context Provider Interface (Provider-Agnostic)

```
has_capability(operator, capability, resource) → bool
tier_raise(resource) → T0..T3          # RAISE only; floor comes from the bundle
snapshot_hash() → sha256
freshness() → age of last authoritative update
```

| Deployment character | Provider class | Freshness contract |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Few operators, contract-driven entitlements | **Static signed entitlement bundle** — changes are deploys | Bundle validity; staleness ≈ 0 |
| Non-human operators, M2M pipelines | **Workload-identity attestation** | Per-request proof; no directory |
| Thousands of operators, rights change daily | **Live directory sync** | ≤ 5 min for revocations, push-based; sync broken → fail closed |

- **CP-1.** Provider selection is declared per tenant in the bundle and is itself a signed, reviewed change.
- **CP-2.** All providers **MUST** honor P-4: unknown operator, unknown resource, or stale freshness resolves to DENY.
- **CP-3.** Evaluation logic is identical across providers; only the source and freshness model differ.
- **CP-4 (NEW).** The provider class is **orthogonal to the fidelity class.** v1.2.0's provider table labelled human-IT operations "Door B," conflating a *provider* property (live sync) with an *ingress* property (free text). A live-sync deployment with typed submission is F-HIGH.

The practical consequence stands: the strongest deployments are the simplest ones. Static signed entitlements eliminate the sync pipeline, the staleness race, and most of the Context Store attack surface in one move.

### 8.9 Signing-Substrate Controls

- **RAD-1.** Per-tenant rate limit: max 100 ALLOW receipts per minute, sliding window.
- **RAD-2.** Burst detection: signing rate beyond 3σ of the 7-day rolling baseline caps that tenant's Decisions at ATTEST for 10 minutes with a critical alert, subject to AQ-2.
- **RAD-3 (REVISED).** **Monotonic epoch binding.** The KMS **MUST** maintain the highest `bundle_epoch` it has ever validated for a tenant, in durable storage, and **MUST** reject any signing request referencing an epoch lower than that value. v1.2.0 used a last-10-hashes history window, which correctly rejected forged and long-obsolete bundles but **permitted replay of a genuine, more permissive bundle from within the window** (T-15). Epoch monotonicity closes that: a superseded bundle is rejected regardless of signature validity.
- **RAD-4. KMS Bundle Independence.** The KMS **MUST** hold its own copy of the `policy_signing_key` public key and **MUST** independently verify the Ed25519 signature of any bundle it consults. It **MUST NOT** accept bundle metadata, epochs, or policy hashes from the Policy Engine runtime without cryptographic verification. On verification failure the KMS **MUST** reject all signing requests until a valid bundle is presented.
- **RAD-5 (NEW in v1.3.23 — Normative). The bundle names its tenant, and the KMS signs for no other.** `manifest.json` **MUST** carry `tenant_id` (§8.2), and it is inside the tree hash because every member is. On every signing request the KMS **MUST** compare the request body's `tenant_id` against the verified bundle's manifest `tenant_id` and **MUST** return `SIGNING_DENIED` on any difference (§9.1.1 step 4a — **before** the RAD-3 mark is written; the order is normative, see there). A manifest that names no tenant is an invalid bundle under PB-1 and **MUST** be refused at load by every consumer — the KMS under RAD-4, the Policy Engine under PB-1, the Executor at §9.3 step 4. The Executor's half of the binding is §9.3 step 8, which now compares the receipt's tenant against the trusted bundle's as well as against the Proposal's.

  *Why.* Through v1.3.22 no bundle named its tenant, so the KMS selected which tenant's `receipt_signing_key` signs from the body's `tenant_id` — a value the Policy Engine wrote, the party under verification, classified **T** in ACP-CLASS-001 — and nothing in §9.1.1 read a signed byte that could disagree. A compromised Policy Engine names tenant B in the body while presenting a bundle only tenant A holds; if the bundle repository is not partitioned by tenant every step of §9.1.1 passes and the KMS mints a receipt under B's key for A's content. A tenant-partitioned repository narrows that to a deployment property and no further: the KMS cannot verify where its own repository reads from, so a partition is not a control it can check. This is PB-6's move exactly — `quorum_k` went into the signed bundle as the only authoritative source (AT-9), and the tenant goes in for the same reason — and it moves the row from **T** toward **B**: the KMS still reads the body's value, but now compares it against a signed one. Found while building the KMS as a service (ACP-139).

  *What this does not do.* It does not derive the tenant from the transport — the control plane is multi-tenant, so the Policy Engine's mTLS identity is not the tenant's — and it does not make the body's `tenant_id` redundant: the body says what the requester *claims*, the manifest says what the bundle *governs*, and the comparison between them is the control. Nor does it bound what a compromised Policy Engine can do *within* its tenant; that is INV-1-HIGH's territory and the quorum's, not this clause's.

  *A correction worth recording (v1.3.24).* As introduced, the comparison was §9.1.1 step **5a** — after step 5 verifies the epoch against the durable high-water mark *and updates it*. The mark is keyed by the tenant the body names, and the write is monotone (CL-4); so in exactly the deployment this clause exists for, a request naming tenant B with tenant A's genuine bundle would have raised B's mark to A's epoch before being denied, locking B out of every lower epoch. The clause stopped the cross-tenant signature and, as numbered, not the cross-tenant lockout. It was found by the product implementation, which had placed the comparison before the write and proved the order by a mutant that moves it back. The step is now 4a, and the order is part of the rule (ACP-144). The reference has no KMS, so this is a per-implementation obligation (`spec/vectors/OBLIGATIONS.md`), not a vector.

## 9. Layer 4 — Decision Receipts, Ledger, and Verified Execution

### 9.1 Rationale

If the Executor acts on the Policy Engine's say-so over a trusted channel, the Policy Engine alone can cause execution, and INV-1-HIGH fails. The remedy: **the Executor trusts a signature, not a channel.** A compromised Policy Engine without the signing key produces nothing the Executor will act on; a compromised Executor without a matching receipt produces an execution provably unauthorized in audit.

### 9.1.1 KMS Independence Protocol (Normative)

1. The KMS holds the `policy_signing_key` public key in hardware-protected storage, loaded at initialization by an operator distinct from the Policy Engine administrator.
2. On every signing request, the KMS extracts the claimed `policy_bundle_hash` and `bundle_epoch`.
3. The KMS retrieves the bundle from a **read-only bundle repository** that the Policy Engine runtime cannot write to. **The isolation boundary MUST be stronger than filesystem permissions on a host shared with the Policy Engine** — separate host, separate credential domain, or hardware-enforced. The repository is populated only by the offline signing ceremony and is TCB (§4.3). v1.2.0 introduced this repository without specifying its integrity model, so a Policy-Engine-host compromise could have supplied attacker-chosen bytes to an "independent" verification.
4. The KMS verifies the bundle's Ed25519 signature against the offline public key, **and (NEW in v1.3.27, PB-12) that the bundle's `receipt_identity.json` names the identity the KMS holds for the tenant** — a bundle naming a key the KMS does not hold is refused here, by the signer, rather than discovered at the Executor's step 1.
4a. **(RAD-5; introduced in v1.3.23 as step 5a, moved here in v1.3.24)** The KMS verifies that the request's `tenant_id` equals the `tenant_id` of the verified bundle's manifest. The body says which tenant the requester *claims*; the manifest says which tenant the bundle *governs*; only the second is a signed byte, and the comparison is the control. **Before step 5, and the order is normative:** the high-water mark is keyed by the tenant the body names — before this comparison, the only tenant the KMS has — and step 5's write is monotone with no way back (CL-4). A write made before this comparison lets a request naming tenant B while presenting tenant A's genuine bundle raise **B's** mark to A's epoch and only then be denied: B locked out of every epoch below it by a request B never made. v1.3.23 numbered the comparison after the write; the order here is the one the product implementation had already taken and mutation-proved (ACP-144).
5. The KMS verifies `bundle_epoch` ≥ its durably stored high-water mark, and updates the mark (RAD-3).
6. Only if 2–5 succeed does the KMS sign with the `receipt_signing_key`.
7. On any failure the KMS returns `SIGNING_DENIED` with a critical alert; the Policy Engine **MUST** propagate a DENY.

### 9.2 Receipt Format

Canonical wire representation is **COSE_Sign1 over CBOR** (RFC 8152, RFC 8949) with Ed25519 (RFC 8032). The JSON below is decoded diagnostic form only.

```json
{
  "receipt_version": 3,
  "decision": "ALLOW",
  "proposal_hash": "sha256:…",
  "schema_id": "modify_firewall_rule",
  "schema_version": "1.2.0",
  "schema_hash": "sha256:…",
  "fidelity": "F-HIGH",
  "policy_bundle_hash": "sha256:…",
  "bundle_epoch": 47,
  "context_snapshot_hash": "sha256:…",
  "rule_id": "RULE-002",
  "risk_level_effective": "HIGH",
  "risk_level_floor_only": "HIGH",
  "attestation_digests": [
    "sha256:1c3f…", "sha256:8ad2…", "sha256:b910…"
  ],
  "tenant_id": "ten_04qf",
  "operator": "op_8842",
  "issued_at": "2026-08-09T14:02:11Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-08-09T14:04:11Z",
  "nonce": "b64:…",
  "audit_id": "aud_01JCM8QK"
}
```

Canonical encoding for hashed structures is RFC 8785 (JCS) for the **Proposal** (**WE-6** names the refusal of a Proposal that has no such form), and canonical CBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2) for the **receipt and the Attestation Object** (WE-1/2, AT-8a). Per AT-8 the attestations carry the **full Attestation Object**, not merely its id; the id is never transmitted for trust and is recomputed by the Executor (§9.3 step 7b(v)). **Under receipt version 3 (§8.6b) the signed body carries `attestation_digests`, sorted per AB-2, and the entries travel beside it.** They are not shown inside the body above because they are not in it — that is the whole of the change. Each entry keeps the shape it had under version 2: Its field set is PR-1's.

- **PR-1 (NEW in v1.3.27 — Normative). The Proposal has one field set, and it is the envelope.** A Proposal is `{schema_id, schema_version, schema_hash, fidelity, tenant_id, payload}` (SR-5, B-6, RAD-5), and `payload` is `{task_type, operator, targets, params, cidrs}`: the action class (V-8, V-11); the operating principal §8.4 step 4 checks every required capability for; the resources the action names — the keys `floors.json` grades, at least one; the registered Input Schema's object, which V-1 closes; and the prefix widths of its CIDR-typed parameters. Every field at both levels is REQUIRED and both objects are closed — AT-8b's rule applied to the Proposal, so one action has one encoding and one `proposal_hash`; `params` and `cidrs` are empty objects when an action has none, never absent. `proposal_hash` is the hash of the canonical encoding of the whole envelope; §8.3.1's typing environment binds each `params` entry under its own name (EL-2) and each target's tier (RK-2); §9.3 step 8 compares the receipt's `tenant_id` against the envelope's and the trusted bundle's. `spec/schemas/wire/proposal.schema.json` is this clause, machine-readable, and `acp_decision::Proposal::from_wire` and `acp_executor.payload()` are its only readers in the two implementations.

  *Why now.* Through v1.3.26 this document stated no field set: §6.3's envelope, the reference's flat object and a third reading between them were each defensible, and `proposal_hash` was a hash over whichever one an implementer chose — invisible until the first end-to-end build put a conformant door's envelope in front of a conformant Executor's step 8, which looked for a tenant the envelope could not carry.
- **PR-2 (NEW in v1.3.27 — Normative). The adapter stamps what the client may not set.** `fidelity` (B-6), `schema_hash` (SR-5) and `tenant_id` are supplied by the Ingress Adapter — the last from the bundle it verified at activation, never from the request — and a submission carrying any of them **MUST** be refused at the door with an audit record (F1.1). A client sends `{schema_id, schema_version, payload}` and nothing else.

```json
{"obj": {"proposal_hash": "sha256:…", "policy_bundle_hash": "sha256:…",
         "bundle_epoch": 47, "context_snapshot_hash": "sha256:…",
         "floor_only_risk": "HIGH", "required_roles": ["net_approver"],
         "required_count": 2, "operator": "op_8842",
         "att_nonce": "b64:…", "expires_at": "2026-08-09T14:55:00Z",
         "alg": "hybrid-ed25519-mldsa65"},
 "kind": "approval", "attester": "op_1121", "sig": {"classical": "…", "pq": "…"}}
```

and its digest is `sha256:` over the canonical encoding of that whole map — object, `kind`, `attester` and `sig` together (AB-1), never over `obj` alone.

> **Authority of `operator` (NEW in v1.3.4).** The top-level `operator` field is **diagnostic only**. The authoritative operator identity for approver-distinctness and the step-9 capability recheck is `attestations[].obj.operator`, which is signature-covered (Y4).

> **Authority of receipt fields (NEW in v1.3.1).** `risk_level_effective`, `risk_level_floor_only`, and `fidelity` are **diagnostic and audit fields only**. They record what the Policy Engine computed, for replay and forensics. They are **NOT authoritative** for any Executor control decision: per TR-8, the Executor recomputes floor-only risk and verifies fidelity from the signed bundle and the canonical Proposal. A receipt whose transmitted values disagree with the Executor's recomputation is a **critical alert** (§9.3 step 7a) — it means the signing substrate is emitting Decisions the bundle does not support.

- **WE-1.** Normative wire format is COSE_Sign1 with Ed25519 over canonical CBOR.
- **WE-2.** The COSE payload is the canonical CBOR encoding of the receipt structure.
- **WE-3.** Implementations MUST provide a reference decoder emitting JSON diagnostic for review, but MUST NOT accept JSON as receipt input.
- **WE-4 (NEW in v1.3.18 — Normative, closes the `b64:` type hole).** **A base64 value carries its type prefix, and the prefix is part of the value.** Every value this document renders as `b64:…` — the attestation nonce (**AT-1**), the receipt `nonce`, and any signature or byte string carried as text — **MUST** be the ASCII string `"b64:"` followed by the standard base64 encoding (RFC 4648 §4, **with** padding) of the value's bytes. It **MUST** be carried, hashed and signed **as that string**. Stripping the prefix, omitting the padding, or substituting the URL-safe alphabet (RFC 4648 §5) each produce a different value and **MUST** be rejected rather than normalized.

  *Rationale, and it is the same one §11.2 already gives one type over.* Through v1.3.17 `b64:` appeared **only** inside §9.2's diagnostic JSON, twice, and no clause said whether the prefix was part of the value. §11.2 pins `sha256:` to the character — *"carried, stored, anchored and fed forward as that string, never as the 32 raw digest bytes"* — and records why it had to: *"an implementer who fed forward raw bytes built a different chain while following the text."* The nonce is worse exposed than the chain hash was. `attestation_id` is SHA-256 over the canonical CBOR encoding of the **whole** Attestation Object (**AT-8a**), so an issuer carrying `b64:AAAA…` and a verifier carrying `AAAA…` derive **two ids for one object** and claim **two ledger slots** — one attestation, consumed twice. That is **Z4** and **T-14** reopening through a type nobody wrote down, reached with **no optional field** and therefore untouched by **AT-8b**, which closed the field-set ambiguity one layer above this one. At the verifier the mismatch is indistinguishable from a forgery.

  *Why a clause and not a schema pattern.* `spec/schemas/wire/attestation_object.schema.json` does pin the pattern, and a pattern in a schema constrains the implementations that read that schema. A second implementation written from this document alone reads nothing but this document — which is the entire premise of the conformance regime (§14) and of certification. A type that exists only in the schema is a type the specification does not have.

- **WE-5 (NEW in v1.3.28 — Normative, closes the instant type hole, ACP-167).** **An instant on the wire has one spelling: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, to one second, UTC, `Z` only.** Every value this document types as an RFC 3339 instant — the Attestation Object's `expires_at` (**AT-1**), the receipt's `issued_at` and `expires_at` (§9.2), the pending-release record's `held_at` and `receipt_expires_at`, the audit record's `occurred_at` (**AU-9**) and the anchor's `anchored_at` — **MUST** be exactly that form: no UTC offset, no fractional seconds, no lower-case `t` or `z`, the day bounded by the actual length of its month, no leap second. Any other rendering **MUST** be rejected rather than normalized. The acknowledgement's `issued_at`/`expires_at` are the one deliberate exception: `acknowledgement.schema.json` declares them integer seconds since the Unix epoch — a reference-level acknowledgement rule (suite 9's family), not a clause of this document — and an implementation **MUST NOT** put a non-integer in them.
- **WE-6 (NEW in v1.3.29 — Normative, gives the adapter's canonicalisation refusal its id, ACP-284).** **The Proposal's canonical encoding is RFC 8785 (JCS), and an Ingress Adapter MUST refuse a submission it cannot canonically encode — before it hashes, records or forwards anything about it.** §9.2 states the encoding; this clause is the refusal's name, and it is the id the adapter's `ingress_refused` record carries (F1.1, AU-9). A submission that parses under **V-6** yet has no JCS form — a number JCS cannot serialise, text that is not well-formed after **V-7**, any input for which the encoder yields no bytes — is refused at the door and **MUST NOT** be re-serialised into a form that does canonicalise. Rationale: `proposal_hash` is SHA-256 over the canonical bytes, so an adapter that accepted what it could not canonicalise would either hash bytes no verifier can reproduce or invent a canonical form of its own, which is a second encoder on the binding path — **AT-8a**'s reason, one object earlier. Until this release the refusal existed in both implementations and cited a section number, which the audit record's schema refuses and the clause index cannot resolve.

  *Rationale, and it is WE-4's one type over.* RFC 3339 as written accepts `2026-08-09T14:02:11Z`, `2026-08-09t14:02:11z`, `2026-08-09T16:02:11+02:00` and `2026-08-09T14:02:11.000Z` as four renderings of **one instant**. Each is a distinct string, and these values sit inside hash preimages: the receipt's `issued_at` in the signed body, the Attestation Object's `expires_at` in the preimage of `attestation_id` (**AT-8a**), `occurred_at` in the AU-1 chain preimage. Four spellings are four ids for one object and four chain hashes for one history — **Z4** and **T-14** reaching a type nobody wrote down, again. Canonicalization cannot repair it, because the ambiguity is in the value, not the encoding. A number would not repair it either: **AT-8a** forbids a float in a canonical structure precisely because a float is not deterministically encoded, and the acknowledgement — the one numeric structure — is where a float reached canonical bytes on every production path until this release.

  *Why now.* Through v1.3.27 the seven fields above were RFC 3339 in the schemas, in AT-1 and in §9.2's example, and **POSIX numbers in both implementations** — which agreed with each other, so the cross-language differential was structurally blind, and an object that satisfied this document was refused by every verifier claiming conformance to it. `tools/instant-type-vectors.json` is the shared corpus; the schema's pattern, the Python parser and the Rust parser are each evaluated against it, and the parsers' calendar checks are stricter than any pattern can be — that gap is enumerated in the corpus rather than argued away.

### 9.3 Executor Verification (Normative Checklist)

Before any state change, the Executor **MUST** verify in order, failing closed on any step:

1. Signature valid under the current `receipt_signing_key` (public key from the signed bundle — `receipt_identity.json`, PB-12, and under nothing else).
2. `decision == "ALLOW"`.
3. `proposal_hash` equals the hash of the Proposal (PR-1's envelope) the Executor independently received and canonicalized. The Executor hashes what it will execute — never "whatever the receipt describes."
4. `policy_bundle_hash` matches the bundle the Executor trusts, and `bundle_epoch` ≥ the Executor's last-seen epoch.
5. `expires_at` not passed; `issued_at` not future beyond ±5 s skew; **`expires_at − issued_at ≤ 120 s` (NEW in v1.3.3; NORMATIVE in v1.3.4, closes Y2: the window *length* is Executor-enforced, not read from the KMS-written value). Violation fails closed with a critical alert.**
6. **`nonce` absent from the Consumption Ledger; claim atomically (§9.3.1).**
7. **Recompute floor-only risk (TR-8)** from the trusted bundle's `floors.json` and `risk_functions.json` applied to the independently-received canonical Proposal, ignoring all Context-Store raises and ignoring the receipt's asserted value. **Verify `fidelity` against the bundle-registered adapter binding for this `schema_id`.** All subsequent attestation requirements key on the **recomputed** values.
7a. **If the recomputed floor-only risk or fidelity disagrees with the value transmitted in the receipt: fail closed and emit a critical alert.** Disagreement means the signing substrate produced a Decision the bundle does not support (T-18 in progress).
7b. **(REWRITTEN in v1.3.3; NORMATIVE in v1.3.4, closes Y1/Y1b/Y4; EXTENDED in v1.3.20 by §8.6b.)** Under receipt version 3 the attestation entries arrive **alongside** the receipt rather than inside it. Before the per-entry loop, and before any attester signature is verified, the Executor **MUST** discharge the list-level obligations of §8.6b, in this order: reject a signed body over 4,096 bytes (AB-6, checked before the receipt signature), reject duplicate digests (AB-3), reject an unsorted `attestation_digests` (AB-2), and verify that the number of received entries equals the length of the signed list (AB-4). The order is normative because an input wrong in more than one way must produce the same refusal name in every implementation — the property the cross-language differential compares. Then, for each attestation entry:

   (0) **(NEW in v1.3.20, AB-1)** **recompute the entry digest from the received bytes — `obj`, `kind`, `attester` and `sig` together — and verify it appears in the receipt's signed `attestation_digests`.** This is the membership check that replaces containment, and it runs *before* (i): an entry that the receipt never committed to must be refused before its signature is examined, or the verifier spends work on attacker-supplied material. A transmitted identifier **MUST NOT** be used in place of the recomputed digest, and the preimage **MUST NOT** be `obj` alone — `kind` and `attester` decide quorum composition and the attester signs neither;
   (i) **verify the attester signature over the canonical encoding of `obj`** against the bundle's attester keys — for a `webauthn` entry, as HM-3 and HM-4 state it, outside the suite floor (CR-8);
   (ii) **verify `obj.proposal_hash` equals the hash computed in step 3** (the executed proposal) — *this is the binding check whose absence is Y1*;
   (iii) verify `obj.policy_bundle_hash` and `obj.bundle_epoch` equal step 4's trusted values, `obj.floor_only_risk` equals the step-7 recomputed value, and **`obj.required_count` equals the bundle's `quorum_k` (PB-6)** — *(REVISED in v1.3.15)*. Through v1.3.13 this read "`obj`'s required roles/counts equal the bundle rule's", naming no bundle field on the right-hand side; AT-9 supplies it. Note what this comparison is **for**: it detects an attester who signed under a different stated threshold than the one being applied, which is an AT-3 consent failure. It is **not** how the threshold is obtained — see (vi);
   (iii-a) **(NEW in v1.3.4, closes Y4)** verify `obj.operator` is identical across every attestation entry, and take the operator identity for distinctness (vi) and for the step-9 capability recheck **from the verified object — never from the receipt body's `operator` field**, which is diagnostic only;
   (iii-b) **(NEW in v1.3.4)** verify the received encoding of `obj` is canonical CBOR per AT-8a; a non-canonical encoding fails closed;
   (iv) verify `obj.expires_at` had not passed at the receipt's `issued_at`;
   (v) **recompute `attestation_id := SHA-256(obj)` per AT-1 — never read the id from the receipt — and claim the recomputed id atomically in the Consumption Ledger** (closes Y1b: there is no transmitted id to substitute);
   (vi) **(REVISED in v1.3.15, closes the §1 (a) defect)** the count of distinct approvals is compared against **`quorum_k`, read from the bundle established in step 4** — never against any value carried by the receipt or by an Attestation Object, and never against `entries[0]` (AT-9). Attester distinctness per AT-2, resolved over registry **keys** and not over names (PB-7); confirmation present if policy required it for the recomputed fidelity and tier.
   Any failure of (i)–(vi) is fail-closed with a critical alert: a validly-signed quorum bound to a *different* proposal means the signing substrate is composing receipts the attesters did not authorize. *(The range was written as (i)–(iv) through v1.3.13, which left (v) and (vi) — the id recomputation that closes Y1b, and the quorum comparison itself — outside the sentence stating their failure mode. That was an editing slip rather than a design choice, and it is corrected here rather than silently: it is precisely the kind of gap this document keeps finding in itself.)*
8. Tenant of the receipt matches the tenant scope of the credentials about to be used, **and (NEW in v1.3.23, RAD-5) equals the `tenant_id` of the trusted bundle established in step 4.** Both comparisons are against artifacts the Executor holds independently of the receipt — the Proposal it canonicalized in step 3 and the signed manifest — never against a second field of the receipt; a receipt that is merely self-consistent about its tenant proves only that its issuer is.
9. **For recomputed floor-only risk HIGH: re-query the Context Store for capability of the operator established in step 7b(iii-a) on the target. If the capability has been revoked, fail closed.** This closes the issuance→execution window (T-10), during which v1.2.0 honored receipts for up to 120 s after revocation with no recheck. Applied to floor-HIGH only, to bound the added round-trip.

### 9.3.1 Consumption Ledger (Normative — generalizes v1.2.0's nonce registry)

One linearizable ledger consumes three artifact classes under one guarantee.

- **CL-1.** The ledger **MUST** provide linearizability: once an identifier is claimed, all subsequent reads by any Executor in the tenant observe it as claimed.
- **CL-2.** Claims **MUST** use compare-and-swap or an equivalent atomic primitive. If the ledger is unavailable, the Executor **MUST** fail closed.
- **CL-3.** Consumed identifier classes:
  - **Receipt nonces** — one execution per receipt (T-09).
  - **Attestation IDs** — one receipt per attestation (T-14). A second receipt bearing the same attester signatures and a fresh nonce is rejected at step 7.
  - **Bundle epochs (KMS)** — the high-water mark consulted by RAD-3 (T-15). This is the **signing** substrate's mark: it constrains what the KMS will issue.
  - **Executor last-seen epochs (NEW in v1.3.19)** — the value §9.3 step 4 compares `bundle_epoch` against, held **per tenant** and read under CL-1 and CL-2 like any other class here, never from process memory (ZIFFER-DEPLOY-001 DP-40, T-15). It is a **distinct class from the KMS mark above and not a second name for it**: RAD-3 constrains what the KMS will *sign*, and step 4 exists precisely because the Executor does not take the signing substrate's word for having got that right (A-6, TR-8). Before this revision no clause made the value durable, made it shared, or said where it lived, so an Executor holding it in memory started at zero and accepted a genuine, correctly signed, **superseded** bundle after any restart — and a second replica accepted one immediately. A deployment **MAY** cache it in process **only as a monotone lower bound**, so a cached value can cause a refusal and never an acceptance. Retention is **indefinite**, for CL-4's reason: an expiring mark is a mark of zero on the far side of the expiry.
  - **Origin bindings (NEW in v1.3.5)** — one immutable `proposal_hash → origin_nonce` per Proposal, claimed atomically with the first receipt nonce (DS-6f, T-22). Unlike the four classes above this is a *binding*, not a consumption: it is written once and read many times, and a rebind attempt **MUST** be a critical alert. Retention is **indefinite** — an expiring origin binding would reopen Z3 for any long-lived re-drive.
- **CL-4.** Retention: ≥ `receipt_validity + 24 h` for nonces and attestation IDs; **indefinite** for epoch high-water marks (an expiring epoch mark would reopen rollback).
- **CL-5.** Multi-Executor deployments **MUST** share the ledger per tenant. Acceptable: strongly-consistent distributed KV with consistent reads, a `SERIALIZABLE` table with unique constraints on `(tenant_id, artifact_class, identifier)`, or a consensus-backed append-only log.
- **CL-6.** Partition behavior: if the ledger cannot confirm absence, the Executor **MUST** fail closed. Availability is a liveness concern; safety is preserved by failing closed.
- **CL-7 (NEW in v1.3.9 — Normative). Ledger writes are check-then-mutate.** Any ledger operation that can fail **MUST** complete its read phase across the quorum before mutating any replica. Specifically, the DS-6f origin binding **MUST** (i) read the binding from a reachable majority, (ii) fail closed if reachable replicas disagree — **never** resolving a security value by majority vote — and (iii) adopt an existing binding where one is found, writing only when none exists. Because any two majorities intersect, a majority always observes a binding a prior majority wrote, so adoption is total rather than best-effort. *Rationale:* the converse ordering leaves a partitioned write permanently split across the replica set, which is a durable denial of service reachable by an ordinary network event and requiring no attacker. Conformance: partition a replica set so that a later majority intersects a prior binding at exactly one node, and assert the prior value is adopted and readable after heal.
- **CL-8 (RENUMBERED in v1.3.15 — was a second CL-7).** Every claim operation (hit and miss) **MUST** be audited with identifier, class, timestamp, and Executor identity.

### 9.4 Execution Constraints

- **EX-1.** The Executor holds **per-action-class, per-tenant scoped credentials**. A wildcard-privileged executor credential is a conformance failure.
- **EX-2.** Executions report `executed | failed | not_attempted | indeterminate` with target correlation IDs into audit.
- **EX-3.** The Executor emits an audit record for **every** verification failure with the offending receipt attached. A signature-invalid receipt reaching the Executor is a **critical alert**.
- **EX-4.** The `policy_signing_key` (offline), `receipt_signing_key` (KMS-held, non-exportable), and attester keys are three distinct key classes. No component holds private keys from more than one class. Bundle forgery requires the offline key; receipt forgery requires the KMS key; attestation forgery requires an attester key *and* is insufficient without a receipt.

### 9.5 Execution Delivery Semantics (NEW — Normative)

v1.2.0 required marking the nonce spent "atomically with execution commit," but execution commits on an **external** system that is not a participant in the ledger transaction. EX-2 quietly conceded the limit ("idempotent where the target API permits") while §2.1 rows 5–6 put non-idempotent, physically and financially consequential targets in scope.

- **DS-1 (REVISED in v1.3.4 — closes Y3).** For targets supporting idempotency keys, the Executor **MUST** use the **action-identity key** defined in DS-6 as the target idempotency key, achieving **exactly-once across re-drives**. Through v1.3.3 this rule named `attestation_id`, which is an *authorization* identifier and is fresh on every re-drive; see DS-6.
- **DS-2.** For targets without idempotency support, the Executor **MUST** default to **at-most-once**: claim the ledger identifier *before* the target call. A crash between claim and completion yields no execution, never a duplicate.
- **DS-3.** At-most-once means an authorized action may be **silently dropped**. Deployments **MUST** implement a reconciliation procedure keyed on the DS-6 `idempotency_key` to detect `indeterminate` outcomes and re-drive them **through a new attestation**, never by replaying the consumed one.
- **DS-4.** At-least-once **MAY** be configured per action class, but **MUST NOT** be configured for floor-HIGH actions on non-idempotent targets. Doubling a trade or an actuator command is a worse failure than dropping it.
- **DS-5.** The delivery class per action class **MUST** be declared in the bundle and recorded in audit.
- **DS-6 (NEW in v1.3.4 — Normative, closes Y3). Action identity is distinct from authorization identity.**
  - **DS-6a.** Every Proposal admitted to execution acquires an **action identity** `action_id = (proposal_hash, origin_nonce)`, where `origin_nonce` is the receipt nonce of the **first** receipt issued for that Proposal. The action identity is fixed at first authorization and **MUST NOT** change across re-drives.
  - **DS-6b.** The target idempotency key is `idempotency_key = SHA-256(canonical(action_id))`. It **MUST** be carried as a distinct receipt field, **MUST** be included in the Attestation Object of every re-drive attestation, and is therefore covered by TR-10 verification: the Executor **MUST** verify the key in the receipt equals the key in the verified Attestation Object and **MUST NOT** accept it as transmitted. A re-drive receipt **MUST** carry the `origin_nonce` of the original receipt, and the Executor **MUST** verify that the original receipt's nonce is recorded as consumed in the Consumption Ledger — a re-drive whose claimed origin was never issued fails closed.
  - **DS-6c.** The *authorization* remains fresh: a re-drive **MUST** carry a new Attestation Object with a new attestation nonce, consumed against the ledger exactly as any other (AT-5, CL-3). Key stability and authorization freshness are independent properties and both hold; mechanized as `Y3_Fixed_RedriveIsDedupped` and `Y3_Fixed_AuthorizationStillFresh` (Annex D).
  - **DS-6d.** Distinct actions **MUST NOT** collide on the key. `Y3_Fixed_DistinctActionsDistinctKeys` (Annex D) discharges this for the DS-6b derivation; a coarser key (e.g. `proposal_hash` alone) would suppress a legitimate *second* execution of an identical Proposal and is a conformance failure.
  - **DS-6e.** Re-drives **MUST** be bounded: a bundle-configured maximum re-drive count per `action_id` (default 3), breach = critical alert and fail closed. An unbounded re-drive loop against an `indeterminate`-returning target is an amplification channel. *No implementation reads this bound yet, so it is not in `limits.json`; it joins PB-13's member with its first reader (v1.3.30).*

  - **DS-6f (NEW in v1.3.5 — Normative, closes Z3). The origin nonce MUST be pinned by the ledger, not claimed by the receipt.** At issuance of the **first** receipt for a Proposal, the Consumption Ledger **MUST** atomically claim an immutable binding `proposal_hash → origin_nonce` alongside the nonce claim itself. On any subsequent re-drive the Executor **MUST** read `origin_nonce` from that ledger binding and derive `idempotency_key` from the value it read. A receipt-carried `origin_nonce` is **diagnostic only**; if present it **MUST** equal the ledger value or the Executor fails closed with a critical alert. The binding is immutable: an attempt to rebind an existing `proposal_hash` to a different origin is a critical alert and fails closed.

    *Rationale (Z3).* DS-6b as drafted in v1.3.4 required the Executor to verify that the claimed `origin_nonce` was "recorded as consumed in the Consumption Ledger." That is a **membership** test: it proves the value is *a* consumed nonce, never that it is *the* origin nonce of this Proposal. A compromised KMS therefore issues a re-drive receipt that passes every check — fresh quorum, honest recomputed risk, valid AT-8 binding — while naming any other consumed nonce as the origin. The idempotency key moves, the target has never seen it, and the floor-HIGH action doubles: exactly the failure DS-6 was written to prevent. Under the RES-8 classification the drafted `origin_nonce` was class **T**, enumerated against no disclosed residual, which by §14 suite 12 is a conformance failure. This is the fourth recurrence of the class (C2 → X1 → Y1 → Z3), again in the machinery the previous fix introduced. Mechanized as `Z3_MembershipCheckDoesNotPinOrigin` (defect) and `Z3_Fixed_DistinctProposalsDistinctKeys` (the fix does not over-collapse).

  *Rationale (Y3).* DS-1 keyed exactly-once on `attestation_id`; DS-3 requires re-driving an `indeterminate` outcome through a **new** attestation, which necessarily carries a new nonce and therefore a new id — a **new idempotency key** presented to the target in exactly the case where the original call may have **succeeded** and only its outcome was lost. The duplicate-prevention mechanism was disabled precisely and only in the recovery path built to cope with lost outcomes, and for floor-HIGH non-idempotent targets (§2.1 rows 5–6) that is the doubled trade or doubled actuator command DS-4 names as the worst failure. Mechanized as `Y3_RedriveDefeatsDedup` (the defect) and `Y3_Fixed_RedriveIsDedupped` (the fix).

### 9.6 Deferred Release (NEW in v1.3.6 — Normative, mitigates A-8)

Verification (§9.3) establishes that a receipt is authentic, bound, fresh, and quorum-satisfying. It cannot establish that the approvers **saw** the action they approved. §9.6 adds an independent detection channel between verification and execution.

- **DR-1.** An action whose recomputed floor-only risk is HIGH **MUST NOT** execute at verification time. The **release mode** — silent (DR-7) or confirmed (DR-9/DR-10) — is determined by the recomputed reversibility class and the sampling draw, never by a transmitted value. It enters `pending_release` and is held for the `hold_window_seconds` the bundle's `limits.json` declares (PB-13; default 60 s, minimum 30 s — L-28). A configuration below the minimum **MUST** be refused at load, under this clause, as an unsatisfiable one: a hold too short for a human to read the summary is not a detection channel — DR-6's shape at the other bound. Release before the window has elapsed **MUST** fail closed.
- **DR-2. Independence of the notification path.** During the hold, a human-readable summary **MUST** be rendered **from the canonical Proposal bytes** by a service that shares **no rendering code path** with the Attestation Presentation Service. The notification service **MUST NOT** obtain display text from any component of the approval chain.

  *This is TR-10/RES-8 restated for rendering.* A summary obtained from the party under verification is that party's *claim* about what it displayed, not evidence. Two channels sourced from one renderer are **one channel wearing two hats**, and a single compromise of that renderer lies to both simultaneously. Implementations **MUST** be able to demonstrate path distinctness structurally — a shared formatting library used by both is a conformance failure even when it renders honestly from canonical bytes, because independence must hold under compromise, not merely in the nominal case.

  *Since v1.3.25* the runtime half of this clause is **DR-14**: the Executor verifies the two summaries' signatures under the two identities PB-11 names in the bundle, and reads no description of itself from either service. The structural half — no shared rendering path — is unchanged, is demonstrated at build time under conformance suite 3, and is what a signature cannot supply.
- **DR-3.** The notification **MUST** be delivered to every attester recorded in the verified Attestation Objects and to the operator, over a channel distinct from the one used to obtain approval.
- **DR-4.** Any notified party **MAY** repudiate during the window. Repudiation **MUST** fail closed with a critical alert. Consumed attestations remain consumed: a repudiated action requires a fresh quorum, never a replay.
- **DR-5.** Repudiation **MUST** be accepted only from a party recorded as notified, and the repudiation path **MUST NOT** depend on any component of the approval chain — otherwise a compromised presentation service suppresses the veto it exists to enable.
- **DR-6. The receipt MUST outlive the hold.** Release **MUST** fail closed if the receipt has expired during the window. Since L-14 caps receipt validity at 120 s, deployments **MUST** satisfy `hold_window + processing margin < receipt validity`, and a `hold_window` at or above the L-14 ceiling is an **unsatisfiable configuration** — no legal receipt can outlive it — which **MUST** be rejected rather than silently never releasing. Testing found this interaction directly: a 60 s hold inside a 60 s receipt window expires mid-hold and never releases the honest path.
- **DR-7. Silence releases only where release is recoverable.** For `REVERSIBLE` action classes, and only there, the absence of repudiation during the window releases the action. The mechanism does not assert that any recipient read the notification; it asserts that the opportunity existed and was not taken, and that if it was missed the action can be undone.

  *Why this is not stated as a general rule.* A control whose default outcome is identical to its approved outcome is a control that teaches its own users to ignore it: if doing nothing and confirming produce the same result, recipients stop confirming, and the notification degrades into a log entry while the dashboard continues to report that a human oversight step exists. That is worse than having no step, because it manufactures false assurance. Silence is therefore permitted as an outcome **only** where the cost of a missed detection is bounded by reversibility, and is **forbidden** by DR-9 where it is not.
- **DR-9 (NEW in v1.3.7). Irreversible actions require positive acknowledgement.** Where the **recomputed** reversibility class (RV-3) is `IRREVERSIBLE`, release **MUST** require an explicit acknowledgement from at least one notified party during the hold window. **Timeout fails closed**, and a timed-out action requires a fresh quorum, never a replay. The acknowledgement **MUST NOT** come from the operator: the party who initiated the action carries no independent information about whether the displayed summary was honest — AT-2's approver-distinctness rule, restated for the release step.
- **DR-10 (NEW in v1.3.7). Sampled confirmation on reversible actions.** The fraction of `REVERSIBLE` floor-HIGH actions the bundle's `limits.json` declares as `sample_percent` (PB-13; default 10%) **MUST** be selected for mandatory acknowledgement under the DR-9 rule. *Rationale:* if recipients can learn that reversible actions never require a response, they stop reading those notifications too, and the detection channel decays for the class that constitutes most of the traffic. Sampling keeps the channel live at a bounded average cost.
- **DR-11 (NEW in v1.3.7). The sampling draw MUST NOT be predictable or influenceable by the requester.** A draw derived from the Proposal, the operator identity, or any requester-supplied value permits grinding inputs until an action falls outside the sample. The draw **MUST** be made by the Executor from a cryptographically secure source, or by an equivalently isolated component, and **MUST** be recorded in audit so the realised rate is verifiable after the fact.
- **DR-12 (NEW in v1.3.7). Silent releases are counted, not forgotten.** Every release without human acknowledgement **MUST** increment a per-tenant counter recorded in audit. Silence is a *measurable debt*, and a deployment whose reversible floor-HIGH traffic releases unacknowledged at a high rate has a visible operational finding rather than an invisible one. Deployments **SHOULD** alert on the rate, not merely record it.
- **DR-8. Undeliverable notification fails closed.** If no recipient is reachable, or delivery to any recipient fails, the action **MUST NOT** release. Executing while the detection channel is absent is executing unwatched.
- **DR-13 (NEW in v1.3.15 — Normative). Irreversible actions below floor-HIGH are notified, not acknowledged.** DR-1 through DR-12 govern the **deferred path**, and DR-1 scopes that path to floor-HIGH. Risk and reversibility are **orthogonal**: risk is recomputed from the target resource's tier floor (TR-5), reversibility is a property of the action class (RV-1), and an action may therefore be `IRREVERSIBLE` and `LOW` at the same time. Before v1.3.15 such an action executed on the fast path with no notification, no acknowledgement, and no record that a human ever existed — RV-1's fail-safe default set a value that nothing below floor-HIGH read. Therefore, where the **recomputed** reversibility class (RV-3) is `IRREVERSIBLE` and the **recomputed** floor-only risk is **below** HIGH:

  1. The Executor **MUST** commit a **notice** of the action — proposal hash, action class, targets, operator, and the recipient set — to its **own durable audit state** *before* the action executes. Executing ahead of the committed notice **MUST** fail closed. This is AU-7's anchor-before-release ordering applied to the fast path, and for the same reason: a record written after the fact can be suppressed by whatever the action enabled.
  2. The recipient set **MUST** be read from the **signed bundle**, keyed by action class. An action class that is `IRREVERSIBLE`, graded below HIGH, and names **no** notice recipients **MUST** fail closed. A notice with no addressee is not a detection channel, and DR-8's rule — executing while the detection channel is absent is executing unwatched — does not become false because the risk grade is lower.
  3. Acknowledgement **MUST NOT** be required, and silence **MUST NOT** block release on this path.

  *Why no acknowledgement, when DR-9 requires one.* DR-9's friction is affordable because floor-HIGH traffic has already paid for a human quorum. Below HIGH there is no quorum, the traffic is the bulk of the deployment, and requiring acknowledgement on every irreversible low-tier action would page a human for routine work at volume. T-26's habituation argument and AT-7's rubber-stamping concession both then apply with full force, and W2 already recorded what saturating approvers produces: not refusal, but assent. The trade taken here is **detection instead of prevention**, chosen deliberately and stated as a weaker guarantee rather than presented as an equivalent one.

  *Why the recipient set lives in the bundle.* A notification service that selects its own audience is certifying its own coverage — RES-8, and exactly the shape of the notifier-self-certification finding (**T-32** in **ACP-CLASS-001** — closed for `note.source_path` and `note.from_canonical` in v1.3.25 by PB-11 and DR-14; `delivered` stays **T**, bounded). Naming recipients in the signed bundle puts the audience under RK-5 two-person control alongside the floors it complements, and makes "who would have found out" a property an auditor can read off the signed policy rather than ask the notifier about.

  *Interaction with EO-2, stated plainly.* EO-2 retains a **25 ms p99** end-to-end budget for LOW and MEDIUM decisions, and a synchronous out-of-band delivery does not fit inside it. Two normative requirements that cannot both hold is the DR-6 defect class, so the resolution is stated rather than left to implementers: what DR-13 makes a precondition of execution is the **durable local commit** of the notice, which is Executor-local and inside the budget. **Actual delivery is asynchronous and is not a precondition of execution.** This is a genuinely weaker obligation than DR-8's confirmed delivery, and the difference is the residual: a notice committed and never delivered leaves an audit record and no human. Deployments **MUST** reconcile committed notices against delivery outcomes and **MUST** alert on the undelivered backlog, which is the DR-12 discipline — silence as measurable debt — applied to a channel where silence is the default rather than the exception.

  *Counted separately from DR-12.* Releases under DR-13 are unacknowledged **by construction**, so folding them into DR-12's counter would swamp the signal DR-12 exists to carry: a floor-HIGH reversible action that released on silence is a fact about human attention, and a below-HIGH irreversible notice is not. They **MUST** be counted as distinct audit classes.

  *What this does not do.* It does not make an irreversible low-tier action safe; it makes it **loud**. An attacker who wins an injected `send_email` from an inbox floored at T1 still sends the mail. The claim is only that the send is no longer invisible, and the question of whether that floor should have been T1 relocates onto **A-7**, which §15 concedes is unprovable. Deployments **SHOULD** floor action classes that are both irreversible and externally visible at **T2 or above**, which moves them onto the deferred path and under DR-9; DR-13 is what holds when they have not.

- **DR-14 (NEW in v1.3.25 — Normative). Independence is verified from signed bytes, never declared.** The approval summary the Attestation Presentation Service showed the attesters and the notification DR-2 requires are both **Rendered Summary** objects: `alg` (CR-1), `role` (`presentation` or `notification`), `proposal_hash` (the canonical Proposal the summary was rendered from) and `summary` (the text); each signed under the key `door_identities.json` names for its `role`, conjunctively over the suite (CR-3), in the Acknowledgement's carrier shape (`obj` beside `sig`). During the hold, and before the notification is delivered, the Executor **MUST**: (i) verify the notification's signature under the `notification` key and the approval summary's under the `presentation` key — an object that verifies under the other role's key, under a key the bundle does not name, or under no key is refused; (ii) compare each object's `proposal_hash` against its **own** canonical hash of the Proposal being held; (iii) on any failure refuse with a critical alert of class `DEFERRED_RELEASE`. `source_path` and `from_canonical` are **withdrawn** from the notification: a description a service gives of itself is not evidence, and a verified signature under a bundle-named key is what the description was standing in for.

  *What this proves, and what it does not.* It proves **who** rendered each summary and **for which action** — so a compromised presentation service can no longer manufacture the out-of-band summary, because the notification key is not among what it holds, and the two-compromise claim of this section's preamble becomes something the Executor checks rather than something a deployment asserts. It does **not** prove the prose is faithful to the bytes: that is DR-2's structural requirement, demonstrated at build time under conformance suite 3, and a signature over a lie is a signed lie. The rows move exactly this far — `from_canonical` and `source_path` (ACP-CLASS-001 rows 24–25) **T → B**; the relation "notification ↔ an independent render path" (R12) is discharged at run time for identity and binding, and at build time, as before, for the rendering.

  *`delivered` stays T, and the bound is stated.* DR-8 consumes the notifier's report of whom it reached (row 26). No signature moves that row: a signed delivery report is still the party under verification describing its own coverage, and requiring a recipient-side receipt would contradict DR-7's rule that silence releases a reversible action at no cost to the recipient. What bounds it is order: the report is consumed only after the notification itself verified under the notification identity's key, so a false report requires that key — the second of the two compromises the two-door argument assumes the attacker lacks — and buys, under that compromise, one hold window of suppressed detection that DR-12's reconciliation surfaces afterwards. Disclosed as bounded beside `decision` and the anchor result; not closed, and not counted as closed.

  *Found by* defining the product's M4 (ACP-47) against the row the plan said would close, and reading `notification.schema.json`'s own account of why it could not: the notification was not a signed structure. CR-1 now lists it, and the schema carries the object.

*Residual.* A-8 is **not** closed, and the residual differs by class. For `IRREVERSIBLE` actions the mechanism does not depend on human attention to fail safe: absence of acknowledgement blocks execution (DR-9), so an ignored notification costs availability, not safety. For `REVERSIBLE` actions an ignored notification does release the action, bounded by the fact that it can be undone and by DR-10 sampling and DR-12 counting. In both cases an attacker holding **both** the presentation service and the notification service defeats the mechanism. The claim is precisely: no *single* compromised component reaches an unauthorized floor-HIGH execution through a display lie, and for irreversible actions no *inattentive human* does either. Mechanization is not attempted — acknowledgement is modelled as an input, but whether the acknowledging human actually read the summary is outside any model.

*Cost, stated plainly.* DR-9 reintroduces friction on the irreversible class, deliberately. The v1.3.6 design minimised friction everywhere and was wrong to: a control whose default outcome equals its approved outcome trains its users to skip it. The correct trade is not uniform low friction but **friction concentrated where a missed detection is unrecoverable**, which is why the classification in RV-1 is load-bearing rather than documentary.

### 9.7 Signature Suites and Cryptographic Agility (NEW in v1.3.8 — Normative)

- **CR-1.** Every signed structure — receipt, Attestation Object, bundle manifest, audit anchor, Rendered Summary (DR-14, v1.3.25) — **MUST** carry an explicit `alg` identifying a **signature suite**: a named set of primitives, registered in the signed bundle. An unregistered or unknown suite **MUST** fail closed.
- **CR-2.** A signature under a suite is a **map from primitive to signature value**, one entry per primitive. A bare scalar signature **MUST NOT** be accepted under any suite, even one with a single primitive: format leniency is a downgrade in disguise.
- **CR-3. Hybrid composition is conjunctive.** Verification succeeds only if **every** primitive in the declared suite verifies, and the supplied set **exactly** matches the suite — no missing entries, **no extra ones**. An accepted extra primitive is an undeclared code path chosen by the party under verification.

  *Rationale.* Disjunctive composition is strictly weaker than its weakest member: an attacker breaking one primitive is unconstrained by the other, so adding an algorithm under OR reduces security. Same structure as INV-1-HIGH's quorum — safety comes from requiring all, not any. Mechanized in Annex D Part V in both directions.
- **CR-4 (REVISED in v1.3.15). The accepted suite floor lives in the signed bundle, and is satisfied by CONTAINMENT.** Each deployment declares a minimum suite. A structure's `alg` satisfies the floor **iff the suite it names contains every primitive the floor's suite names**; anything else **MUST** fail closed with a critical alert. Extra primitives are permitted; a missing one never is, whatever is offered in its place. The floor is **never** taken from a transmitted value — this is RK-1's tier floor applied to cryptography, and lowering it is an RK-5 change (offline key, author and reviewer distinct from the proposer).

  *Rationale, and a correction (v1.3.15).* Through v1.3.13 this clause said "ranks below", which presumes a **total order** over suites. There is none. A suite is a *named set of primitives* (CR-1), and those sets are incomparable: `hybrid-ed25519-mldsa65` is `{classical, ML-DSA}` and contains no SLH-DSA, while `slhdsa128s` is `{SLH-DSA}` and contains no classical leg. Neither dominates. Every implementation that read "ranks" built a rank table, and every such table placed hybrid above `slhdsa128s` — so a deployment that set its floor to `slhdsa128s` **precisely because** it wanted a hash-based signature resting on no lattice assumption was served a lattice signature and told its floor was met. That is not a stronger suite being accepted; it is one hardness assumption silently substituted for another, against an offline policy decision CR-4 exists to make un-negotiable. Containment is the only comparison that is well-defined over sets, and it has the further merit of forcing a deployment that genuinely wants "either of these two" to say so as two floors rather than to smuggle it through an ordering.
- **CR-5.** `alg` is an **AT-1 field** and therefore signature-covered: an issuer cannot rewrite the suite without invalidating the object. It is likewise covered by the receipt signature.
- **CR-6.** Deployments **SHOULD** register `hybrid-ed25519-mldsa65` (FIPS 204) as the floor for receipts and attestations, and **SHOULD** use SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) for audit anchoring and bundle signing.
- **CR-7.** Suite migration is **forward-only**: the floor may be raised at any epoch; lowering it is an RK-5 change. A deployment **MUST** verify structures signed under a *higher* suite than its floor.
- **CR-8 (NEW in v1.3.30 — Normative, ACP-288). Human legs are outside the suite floor.** CR-4's containment applies to machine suites. A `webauthn` registry entry's assertion is verified under HM-3 and HM-4 and is never compared against `min_suite`, because no authenticator produces a post-quantum signature and the post-quantum binding of a human's decision is the receipt's and the anchor's (HM-6). `webauthn-es256` and `webauthn-ed25519` are the names of HM-4's two key types; they are attestation-entry suites only and **MUST NOT** appear as a bundle, receipt or door suite.

*Performance note.* ML-DSA-65 signatures are roughly two orders of magnitude larger than Ed25519, and a floor-HIGH receipt now carries full Attestation Objects (AT-8) each hybrid-signed. Receipt size and verification cost both rise materially. Deployments **MUST** re-measure against EO-2 (< 25 ms p99 end-to-end warm) rather than assume the budget holds. This document does not relax EO-2: a deployment that cannot meet it under hybrid suites has a capacity finding, not a licence to downgrade.

## 10. Invariant Analysis (Single-Component Compromise)

Conditional on A-1 through A-9.

| Compromised component | What the attacker gains | INV-1-HIGH | Why the bound holds |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Client / ingress adapter | Submit arbitrary bytes; for F-HIGH, arbitrary authorized Atoms | **No violation** *if confirmation is configured*; otherwise per A-1 the operator is authorized and intent is out of scope | Closed grammar rejects non-conforming shapes; floor-HIGH still requires attestation. Where confirmation is required, the operator's own signature is needed and a compromised client cannot produce it. |
| Model / translator | Arbitrary output content | No violation | No tools, no egress (B-2); output must pass a closed Output Schema; a valid-shaped malicious Proposal still faces capability, risk, accumulator checks, and — if floor-HIGH — quorum. |
| Input/Output Validator | Pass-through of malformed artifacts | No violation | Policy Engine re-attests schema (step 1) via bundle-registered hashes; Executor hashes the canonical Proposal itself. |
| Policy Engine | Emit arbitrary Decision content | **No violation.** MEDIUM auto-allows bounded by RAD-1/2, detectable via replay. | Cannot forge attester signatures; cannot alter the bundle (PB-4); **cannot reuse an attestation — `attestation_id` is ledger-consumed (CL-3)**; cannot induce signing under a superseded bundle (RAD-3 epoch monotonicity). |
| KMS / signing substrate | Forge receipts for arbitrary Decisions, including forged derived-risk and fidelity fields | **No violation.** MEDIUM forgery possible for the current bundle. | Cannot forge attester signatures; **cannot replay a valid attestation onto a second receipt (CL-3)**; epoch high-water mark is durable; **cannot suppress the attestation requirement by asserting a lower floor-only risk or a stronger fidelity class, because the Executor recomputes both from the signed bundle (TR-8) and fails closed on disagreement (§9.3 step 7a).** In v1.3.0 this row was wrong: derived risk was read from the receipt, so a single KMS compromise could execute a floor-HIGH action with no attestation. **In v1.3.2 this row was wrong again, for the adjacent reason (Y1): it answered the T-14 *replay* question ("cannot replay a valid attestation onto a second receipt") and never asked the *binding* question. CL-3 guarantees one receipt per attestation, not the *right* receipt; first-use misbinding is not replay. Closed in v1.3.4 by AT-8 binding verification — the KMS cannot attach a quorum raised for P₁ to a receipt for P₂ because the Executor reconstructs and checks the signed bytes.** |
| **Context Store** | Falsify capabilities; assert tier raises | **No violation.** INV-1-MEDIUM violated. | **Cannot lower effective tier below the signed floor (TR-4, `FloorDominance`), so it cannot suppress the escalation trigger.** It can raise tier (more attestation — safe) or withhold capability (DENY — safe). This is the v1.2.0 break that is now closed by construction rather than by argument. |
| **Attestation Presentation Service** | Misrepresent the Proposal to attesters | **Violation possible — disclosed, not denied.** | Per A-8 this component is TCB. Baseline mitigations: bundle-signed templates, floor-derived display values, `proposal_hash` shown. Full mitigation requires device-side re-render (§12.6), which is a SHOULD, not baseline. |
| **Consumption Ledger** | Permit replay / attestation reuse | **Violation possible — disclosed.** | TCB per §4.3. CL-1/CL-2 require linearizability and fail-closed; a ledger that falsely reports "absent" reopens T-09 and T-14. Mitigate by consensus-backed implementation and CL-8 auditing. |
| **Bundle Repository** | Supply attacker-chosen bundle bytes to the KMS | **No violation** *if §9.1.1 step 3 isolation holds* | Signature verification against the offline public key still fails for forged bundles; epoch monotonicity blocks genuine-but-superseded ones. |
| Executor | Act on target systems | No violation | Only within per-action-class scoped credentials; any act without a matching verified receipt is provable in audit by absence; blast radius = one credential scope. |
| Audit subsystem | Suppress/alter evidence | No violation | Per-tenant hash chains with externally anchored heads: suppression breaks the chain, alteration breaks anchored hashes. |
| Attester (one) | One malicious attestation | No violation | Quorum ≥ 2 with distinctness for floor-HIGH. |

**Honest residual.** INV-1-HIGH is robust to any single compromise of the *original* component set, and the two v1.2.0 breaks (tier suppression, attestation amplification) are closed structurally. The cost is that three components have been **added** to the TCB — the Attestation Presentation Service, the Consumption Ledger, and the Bundle Repository — and compromise of the first two does defeat INV-1-HIGH. This is not a regression: those components existed in v1.2.0 as unstated dependencies (HA-1, HA-2) and were doing the same load-bearing work while absent from the trust table. Naming them makes the residual auditable.

INV-1-MEDIUM remains violated by single compromise of Policy Engine, KMS, or Context Store, bounded by rate limits and detectable by replay. Two-component collusion exceeds the stated invariant; deployments needing resistance should raise sensitive **floors** to force quorum and add attestation (§12.4).

## 11. Audit Subsystem

### 11.1 Record Content

Every pipeline event produces one record (AU-9). Four fields are universal: `event_class`, `tenant_id`, `seq` (AU-2) and `occurred_at` (RFC 3339, in the rendering §9.2 uses). The rest are the class's, and a record carries exactly its class's set — no more, no fewer:

| `event_class` | Further fields, all REQUIRED for the class | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ingress_refused` | `fidelity`, `schema_id`, `raw_input_hash`, `clause` | Ingress Adapter (F1.1) |
| `decision` | `session`, `operator`, `fidelity`, `schema_id`, `schema_version`, `schema_hash`, `raw_input_hash`, `proposal_hash`, `policy_bundle_hash`, `bundle_epoch`, `context_snapshot_hash`, `receipt_nonce`, `attestation_ids`, `risk_level_floor_only`, `risk_level_effective`, `decision` | Executor, after §9.3 (F6.1) |
| `verification_failed` | `clause`, `proposal_hash`, `receipt_nonce` — the offending receipt, attached by its nonce (EX-3) | Executor |
| `hold` | `proposal_hash`, `operator`, `risk_level_floor_only`, `receipt_nonce` | Executor (DR-1) |
| `notice` | `proposal_hash`, `operator`, `recipients` | Executor (DR-13, committed before execution) |
| `release` | `proposal_hash`, `operator`, `risk_level_floor_only`, `outcome` (`executed` \| `refused`), `acknowledged_by` | Executor (DR-7, DR-9, DR-10; DR-12's counter is the `release` records whose `acknowledged_by` is empty) |
| `execution` | `proposal_hash`, `receipt_nonce`, `outcome` (`executed` \| `failed` \| `not_attempted` \| `indeterminate`), `correlation_id` | Executor (EX-2) |

`schema_id`, `schema_version` and `schema_hash` on a `decision` record are SR-5's triple; the hashes are §11.1's *all relevant hashes* made per-class readable. `spec/schemas/wire/audit_record.schema.json` declares every field optional at the schema layer and this table makes them required by class, because a conditional requirement is not a thing the generator has a rule for and a consumer must refuse before it hashes (AU-9).

### 11.2 Chain Construction

**Hash notation for this section (NEW in v1.3.15 — Normative).** Throughout §11, `H(x)` denotes the ASCII string `"sha256:"` followed by the SHA-256 digest of `canonical(x)` rendered in **lowercase hexadecimal** — 64 hex characters, 71 characters in total. `canonical()` is the single canonical encoding required by AT-8a (§8.6) — canonical CBOR, RFC 8949 §4.2 — the same one used for signing and id derivation everywhere else in this document. Chain values are carried, stored, anchored **and fed forward as that string**, never as the 32 raw digest bytes. The type is pinned here because it was not pinned before, and an implementer who fed forward raw bytes built a different chain while following the text.

- **AU-1 (REVISED in v1.3.15 — Normative).** Chains are per-tenant.
  `chain_hash_n = H({"prev": chain_hash_{n-1}, "record": record_n})` — the canonical encoding of a **two-key map** whose keys are exactly `prev` and `record`. The key names are part of the preimage. `chain_hash_0` is defined by AU-8.

  *Rationale, and a correction (v1.3.15).* Through v1.3.13 this clause read `SHA-256(chain_hash_{n-1} ‖ canonical(record_n))` — a **concatenation**, which is the conventional formulation and was wrong here for a structural reason. `canonical()` is this document's **one** encoding rule; `‖` is a **second** one, expressing a framing discipline that no canonicaliser covers, no conformance suite exercises, and no vector can express. That is precisely the encoding-split defect AT-8a (§8.6) exists to prevent, introduced by the clause that defines the tamper-evidence chain. Putting the whole preimage through `canonical()` removes the second rule rather than documenting it. **The clause moved, not the implementations**, and the reasoning is recorded because the default runs the other way: this document is the normative source and an implementation disagreeing with it is the thing that is wrong. The exception is argued here rather than taken silently.
- **AU-2.** `chain_hash` carries a UNIQUE constraint; `previous_hash` is a foreign key; `(tenant_id, seq)` is UNIQUE and gapless. Inserts append under `SERIALIZABLE` or single-writer-per-tenant discipline. **(AMENDED in v1.3.28, ACP-164.)** The writer **proposes** `seq` — the record's schema requires it, so a typed writer cannot omit it — and the receiver **MUST** refuse a record whose proposed position is not the one it was about to assign, naming the expected position in the refusal; it **MUST NOT** append at the writer's number. The refusal-with-expected is the retry protocol for concurrent writers. RES-8 holds unchanged: the receiver decides, and a writer that names the right position has gained exactly nothing over one that named none.
- **AU-3.** **External anchoring is REQUIRED** at ≤ 10 min intervals and at every bundle activation, using cryptographic primitives: a public transparency log with inclusion proofs, a threshold signature from ≥3 independent parties, or RFC 3161 timestamping. WORM storage MAY be a durability layer but **MUST NOT** be the sole anchor. An unanchored in-database chain is tamper-*decorated*, not tamper-*evident*.
- **AU-3a.** Every anchor **MUST** be independently verifiable by any party holding the anchor public keys.
- **AU-4.** Anchors are verified on schedule by a process outside the production trust domain; a head failing to extend a previously anchored head is a critical integrity alert.
- **AU-5.** Retention: Decisions, receipts, attestations, anchors ≥ 24 months or per regulation, whichever is longer.
- **AU-7 (NEW in v1.3.10 — Normative, closes W3). Floor-HIGH executions MUST be anchored before release.** The audit record of a floor-HIGH Decision **MUST** be covered by an external anchor before the action is released (§9.6); release **MUST** fail closed otherwise.

  *Rationale (W3).* AU-3 anchors on a ≤ 10 min schedule while a floor-HIGH action is verified, held 60 s, then executed. An execution can complete up to ten minutes before its record is anchored, and in that window the chain is — in AU-3's own words — tamper-*decorated*, not tamper-*evident*. A compromised audit writer rewrites the record of an executed floor-HIGH action before any anchor covers it, defeating §11.3 reconciliation, which is the mechanism by which several disclosed residuals (Y1's included) are said to be *detected* rather than prevented. **Detection that can be erased is not detection.**

  *This costs no new latency,* which is why it belongs here and not in future work: DR-1 already holds every floor-HIGH action 60 s, and that window is idle. Anchor unavailability during the hold is a DR-8-class condition — fail closed, never release unanchored.
- **AU-8 (NEW in v1.3.10 — closes Y5.1; TYPE PINNED in v1.3.15). Chain genesis is specified.** `chain_hash_0 = H({tenant_id, created_at, bundle_epoch, schema_version})` over a **tenant-creation record**, using the `H` of AU-1's notation — so genesis and every subsequent link carry the same type, anchored **immediately** on tenant creation, not on the ≤ 10 min schedule. *Rationale:* without an anchored genesis, deletion of an entire tenant chain is detectable only after the first scheduled anchor, so a chain destroyed inside its first ten minutes leaves no evidence it existed.
- **AU-9 (NEW in v1.3.27 — Normative). The record's vocabulary is pinned, per event class.** `event_class` is one of `ingress_refused`, `decision`, `verification_failed`, `hold`, `notice`, `release`, `execution`; every record carries `event_class`, `tenant_id`, `seq` and `occurred_at`; each class carries exactly the further fields §11.1's table names for it, and a consumer **MUST** refuse a record whose field set is not its class's — before hashing, because AU-1 hashes what it accepts, and a record chained and then refused is a record chained. `occurred_at` is the timestamp's key name, carried in WE-5's spelling, and `anchored_at` the anchor's; `outcome` carries EX-2's values on an `execution` record and `executed`/`refused` on a `release`, and a consumer **MUST** refuse a record whose `outcome` is outside its class's domain (AMENDED in v1.3.28, ACP-164) — a `release` that is neither executed nor refused falls out of §11.3(g)'s anchor-coverage question the way an honest refusal does, which is the reading an attacker wants for a release they would rather not have reconciled.

  *Why.* AU-1 puts the record inside the chain preimage. Through v1.3.26 `event_class` had no value domain (this repository alone held three), the timestamp had no key name, and nothing in the record said what ran — so two conformant implementations wrote different chain hashes for identical histories, AU-3a's independent verifier could recompute neither, and §11.3 (a), (f) and (h) had no field to read. Found by the first audit service to accept the generated record (ACP-153, items 16–18).
- **AU-6 (REVISED in v1.3.10 — closes W2).** If anchoring is unreachable, the system **SHALL** continue chaining internally but **SHALL** cap new Decisions at ATTEST until anchoring resumes, subject to AQ-2. Critical alert immediately. Gap records anchor in one batch on restore. **The ATTEST cap MUST NOT compound with DR-9 into unbounded human load (W2):** during an anchoring outage a deployment **MUST** either (i) suspend DR-10 sampling, so only genuinely irreversible actions demand acknowledgement, or (ii) fail closed entirely for the affected tenant. *Rationale:* an attacker denying the anchoring service otherwise forces every action through human quorum **and** human acknowledgement at once. That is RES-2 composing into safety rather than mere availability — the predictable outcome of saturating approvers is not refusal but rubber-stamping, degrading precisely the control DR-9 exists to provide. An availability attack that manufactures approver fatigue is a safety attack with one extra step.

### 11.3 Reconciliation

A scheduled job **MUST** reconcile:
(a) every execution record ↔ exactly one valid receipt (orphan executions = critical);
(b) every floor-HIGH receipt ↔ attestations satisfying its rule;
(c) **every `attestation_id` ↔ exactly one receipt and at most one execution** (NEW — the check whose absence permitted T-14);
(d) **every signing event ↔ a `bundle_epoch` ≥ all prior epochs** (NEW — rollback detection);
(e) sampled Decisions re-derived via replay ↔ recorded Decisions (mismatch = critical);
(f) **`indeterminate` execution outcomes surfaced for DS-3 handling** (NEW);
(g) **every floor-HIGH execution record ↔ an anchor covering it, dated at or before release** (NEW in v1.3.10 — AU-7 enforcement);
(h) **every accumulator increment ↔ a released execution** (NEW in v1.3.10 — AC-5 enforcement).
Findings are themselves audited. **Reconciliation runs in the anchor-verifier's trust domain (AU-4), never the production domain** — otherwise its findings are written to the chain it audits by a party inside the domain under suspicion.

---

## 12. Deployment Requirements

- **D-1.** Tenant separation: dedicated containers per tenant for ingress/validation/engine, dedicated per-tenant database schemas, dedicated per-tenant executor credentials. Container isolation is a *soft* boundary and **MUST NOT** be represented as hardware isolation in any external claim.
- **D-2.** The model path has **no route** to the Executor network segment, the Context Store, the Consumption Ledger, or the audit database. Enforced by network policy, verified by test.
- **D-3 (NEW).** The Bundle Repository **MUST** be isolated from the Policy Engine host per §9.1.1 step 3.
- **12.2 Transport.** mTLS on every inter-component link; SPIFFE-style workload identity RECOMMENDED. Receipts remain REQUIRED even over mTLS — channel security ≠ authorization proof.
- **12.3 Keys.** Rotation: receipt keys ≤ 90 days; bundle keys ≤ 1 year; rotation events are bundle changes, audited and anchored.
- **12.4 Attestation Roadmap (Informative).** Policy Engine and Executor in confidential VMs (SEV-SNP, TDX) with remote attestation; receipt verification extended to check engine attestation evidence. None of this changes the wire formats.
- **12.5 Time Synchronization.** All receipt-issuing and verifying components **MUST** use NTS (RFC 8915). If unavailable, cap Decisions at ATTEST until restored, subject to AQ-2. Skew allowance ±5 s.
- **12.6 Attestation Device Rendering (Informative, SHOULD for high assurance).** Attesters **SHOULD** re-render the Proposal from canonical bytes on a device distinct from the Presentation Service and compare the displayed `proposal_hash`. This reduces A-8 from a trust assumption to a detection control.
- **12.7 Capability-Scoped Execution (Informative).** Executors **SHOULD** implement action handlers as WebAssembly components with WASI capabilities scoped per receipt action class, granting no ambient authority.

## 14. Conformance

An implementation is **Door A Conformant** iff it satisfies every MUST/MUST NOT in §§2–15 and passes the following suites, which **MUST** ship with the implementation:

1. **Grammar suite** — per schema: accepted canonical vectors; rejected vectors for every field boundary (length ±1, range ±1, pattern near-misses), unknown-field injection, duplicate keys at all depths, depth bombs, **Unicode confusables/bidi/zero-width (V-7)**, oversize pre-parse, **envelope/payload `task_type` mismatch (V-11)**.
2. **Determinism suite** — golden-file replay: recorded (Proposal, bundle, Context) triples re-evaluate to byte-identical Decisions across versions and platforms.
3. **Receipt suite** — Executor rejects: bad signature, wrong key epoch, expired, future-dated, spent nonce, proposal-hash mismatch, bundle-hash mismatch, **lower bundle epoch**, missing/insufficient/duplicate attestations, **reused `attestation_id`**, cross-tenant receipt, **a validly-signed receipt asserting `risk_level_floor_only` below the bundle-derived value (T-18), and a validly-signed receipt asserting `fidelity: "F-HIGH"` for a Proposal from an F-LOW-bound adapter.** The last two MUST fail closed with a critical alert, not merely be logged. **NEW (v1.3.4, NORMATIVE): a validly-signed receipt carrying genuine attestation signatures whose Attestation Objects bind a *different* `proposal_hash` than the executed proposal (Y1) MUST fail closed with a critical alert; a receipt whose transmitted `attestation_id` differs from the object-derived id (Y1b) MUST fail closed; a receipt with `expires_at − issued_at > 120 s` (Y2) MUST fail closed; a receipt whose body `operator` differs from `attestations[].obj.operator` MUST fail closed and MUST NOT be resolved in favour of the body (Y4); an Attestation Object in non-canonical CBOR MUST fail closed (AT-8a); a re-drive receipt whose `idempotency_key` differs from the Executor's ledger-derived value, or whose claimed `origin_nonce` differs from the pinned ledger binding, MUST fail closed (DS-6f, Z3); an Attestation Object carrying an unknown field or omitting any AT-1 field MUST be rejected rather than normalized (AT-8b, Z4).** **NEW (v1.3.15):** a quorum threshold taken from any transmitted value rather than recomputed from the bundle's `quorum_k` MUST fail closed, and an Attestation Object whose `required_count` differs from `quorum_k` MUST fail closed independently of whether the quorum was met (AT-9, PB-6); a bundle whose attester registry maps two identities onto one verification key MUST be refused at load (PB-7). **NEW (v1.3.6, §9.6):** a floor-HIGH action MUST NOT execute at verification time; release before `hold_window` MUST fail closed (DR-1); a notification service sharing a rendering code path with the Attestation Presentation Service MUST be rejected **even when it renders honestly from canonical bytes** (DR-2); incomplete or empty notification delivery MUST fail closed (DR-8); repudiation from a non-notified party MUST be refused (DR-5); a hold outliving receipt validity, or configured at or above the L-14 ceiling, MUST fail closed (DR-6). **NEW (v1.3.7):** an IRREVERSIBLE action released without acknowledgement MUST fail closed (DR-9); an acknowledgement from the operator MUST be refused (DR-9); a sampled REVERSIBLE action released without acknowledgement MUST fail closed (DR-10); a receipt asserting a reversibility class different from the recomputed one MUST fail closed (RV-3); an action class absent from `reversibility.json` MUST behave as IRREVERSIBLE (RV-1). **NEW (v1.3.15, §9.6):** an action whose recomputed reversibility is IRREVERSIBLE and whose recomputed floor-only risk is below HIGH MUST NOT execute before a notice of it is durably committed (DR-13), and MUST fail closed where the signed bundle names no notice recipients for that action class — a notice with no addressee being no detection channel. **NEW (v1.3.8):** a structure whose `alg` names a suite not containing every primitive of the bundle floor's suite MUST fail closed (CR-4); a hybrid signature missing any declared primitive, carrying any undeclared extra primitive, or carrying a forged value for one primitive alongside a genuine one, MUST fail closed (CR-3); a bare scalar signature MUST be refused (CR-2); an unknown suite identifier MUST fail closed (CR-1).
4. **Composition suite** — accumulator thresholds trigger at N, not N−1; risk escalators fire on each declared condition independently and jointly; **permutation tests: shuffling the condition order yields identical risk (RK-3)**; **append-monotonicity tests**.
5. **TOCTOU suite** — capability revoked between quorum and issuance voids the attestation (AT-4); **capability revoked between issuance and execution blocks a floor-HIGH execution (§9.3 step 9)**.
6. **Adversarial suite** — known prompt-injection payloads embedded in every string field of every schema: 100% MUST be either rejected by grammar or demonstrably inert. **For F-LOW adapters, this suite tests containment, not prevention** — success is "injection cannot exceed the operator's capability envelope and cannot bypass confirmation," never "injection does not occur."
7. **Audit suite** — chain verification detects single-record tamper, deletion, reorder; anchor verification detects full-chain rewrite.
8. **Evaluator correctness suite** — the mechanized proof of Annex B, **executed** (record in §1.1), with complete verifier output per B.7, the mutation kill set (B.2a) re-run, and the differential validation of **both** production evaluators — Policy Engine and Executor TR-8 path — against the compiled model (B.7 item 4). Deployments MUST re-execute all three against the artifact hash they ship. **NEW (v1.3.4): parser conformance.** Because Annex B quantifies over parsed `Expr` values, the parser is outside the proof TCB and MUST be tested separately: the suite **MUST** include mixed-connective **source-text** vectors asserting EL-1 precedence and associativity, and **MUST** be run against the deployment's own parser, not only its evaluator. `diff_prose.py` is the reference method — two evaluators written independently from the specification prose, diffed on generated source text. A deployment whose parser disagrees with EL-1 on any vector is non-conformant.
9. **Floor-integrity suite (NEW)** — with the Context Store adversarially controlled, no sequence of tier raises causes any resource to evaluate below its signed floor, and no floor-HIGH action reaches ALLOW without attestation.
10. **Ledger suite (NEW)** — under concurrent Executors and induced partitions: no nonce double-claim, no `attestation_id` double-claim, no epoch regression, fail-closed on partition.
11. **Empirical validation suite** — every conformance claim supported by either (a) an executed mechanized proof, or (b) a red-team report by a party distinct from the implementation authors, demonstrating no single-component bypass achieves an unauthorized floor-HIGH state change. The report **MUST** be published with the conformance claim. **Status (v1.3.4): partially satisfied.** ACP-REVIEW-002 is an independent pass covering §§8.6, 9, 11, the Annex D artifact, and the §8.3.1 parser layer. It does **not** cover §§6–7 ingress, §8.5 accumulators, or §11 anchoring operations. Suite 11 is **not** closed until those surfaces are covered by a qualified party.
12. **Field-and-relation audit suite (NEW in v1.3.4 — from RES-8/RES-9).** The implementation **MUST** ship a mechanical classification table for **every** input any component consumes for a control decision, classifying each as **R** (recomputed by the consumer), **B** (cryptographically bound to something the consumer already trusts), or **T** (trusted as transmitted from the party under verification). Every **T** entry **MUST** be enumerated against §10's disclosed residuals; **any unlisted T is a conformance failure.** The table **MUST** additionally enumerate every claimed *binding* between artifacts on which a control decision depends and show the verification that discharges it (TR-10). Rationale: this method found Y1 where three narrative adversarial passes did not, and cost an afternoon. **Reference artifact: `ACP-CLASS-001`**, which classifies this specification as written (17 Executor inputs, 12 other-consumer inputs, 10 claimed relations; 0 undisclosed T). **A deployment MUST re-derive the table against its own build** — an implementation can introduce a T the specification does not have, for example by caching a bundle rather than re-reading it, or by accepting a pre-parsed expression tree from a shared library instead of parsing under EL-1 itself. **Definedness precedes classification:** for each input, the specification must determine a unique value independent of implementation choice. Z1 was invisible to classification precisely because an ambiguous parse is not a *trusted* value but an *undefined* one, and the classifier silently normalizes it; differential testing against the prose (`diff_prose.py`) is the complementary method that catches that class.

## 15. Security Considerations (Summary of Honest Limits)

0. **RES-0 (NEW in v1.3.15): what §14's differential evidence cannot tell you.** Two classes of test in §14 compare independent readings and treat disagreement as the finding. Both are blind in the same direction, and CR-4 was the demonstration.

   - **Implementation differential** (reference against a second implementation on a shared corpus) detects *divergence*. It is silent on a defect both implementations share, and the probability they share one is not small: the second is normally written by reading the first, so a misreading propagates with the code. CR-4's rank table was byte-for-byte agreed across both languages, asserted by a passing test, and wrong in both.
   - **Prose differential** (§14 suite 6, two evaluators written from this text alone) detects *ambiguity in the text*. It is silent on a defect the text states clearly and wrongly. CR-4 said "ranks below"; two faithful readings would have agreed, and both would have been exploitable.

   Neither method has any purchase on a requirement whose right-hand side is undefined (PB-6's predecessor) or whose comparison is undefined over its domain (CR-4's ordering). Those are found by classification (§14 suite 12, and note that the method found nothing here until its *enumeration* step was redone rather than re-affirmed), by adversarial review, or by an implementer noticing they cannot locate what a clause refers to. **A green differential run is evidence that this document has been read consistently. It is not evidence that it is right.**

1. **The guarantee is anti-injection and anti-forgery, not anti-harm.** Domain semantics are not evaluated; dual-use valid inputs require §7.4 screening.

2. **RES-1: Honest floors (A-7).** The architecture guarantees no runtime component evaluates a resource below its signed floor. It cannot know whether the floor was set correctly. A resource whose floor understates its true sensitivity is outside INV-1-HIGH's protection entirely. Floor maintenance is the highest-leverage governance task in the system.

3. **RES-2: Induced fail-closed → attestation flood.** DoS is out of scope, but every fail-closed control routes to ATTEST, and a flooded quorum converges to rubber-stamping (AT-7), silently converting floor-HIGH into effective-ALLOW. §8.6a mitigates by queue partitioning and rate-limiting; it does not eliminate the composition. This was fully implicit in v1.2.0 and never stated.

4. **RES-3: At-most-once means actions can be dropped.** For non-idempotent targets, DS-2 prefers a missed execution over a duplicate one. Deployments must operate the DS-3 reconciliation path or they will silently lose authorized actions.

5. **RES-4: Attestation decays.** AT-6 is normative operational hygiene, not advice. An unmonitored quorum becomes a rubber stamp. There is no mechanical fallback.

6. **RES-5: Three components entered the TCB.** The Attestation Presentation Service, Consumption Ledger, and Bundle Repository are load-bearing. Two of them defeat INV-1-HIGH if compromised. They were load-bearing in v1.2.0 too, but unnamed.

7. **RES-6: Value conditioning is not eliminated.** Grammar bounds the alphabet, not the semantics. An adversary choosing among allowlisted values still steers model behavior (§7.1).

8. **RES-7: F-LOW is contained, not secured.** Free-text ingress admits injection by construction. Containment rests on capability limits, confirmation, and receipts. No claim of injection prevention at an F-LOW membrane is conformant (FC-3).

9. **Grammar breadth is the enemy.** Every added schema, widened bound, and new enum member spends the auditability budget that justifies this architecture. If the registry is growing monthly, the system is becoming the general-purpose API it was built to replace.

10. **Empirical validation is required.** Architectural soundness is not implementation correctness. Until Annex B is executed and a red-team report exists, the invariants are conditional theorems, not proven facts (§1.1).

11. **RES-8: Derived values must be recomputed, not transmitted (v1.3.1).** The v1.3.0 draft reintroduced the v1.2.0 defect class in a new location: a control decision keyed on an attacker-influenceable value. The general principle, now stated as TR-8: **a verifier must never accept a derived security value from the party it is verifying.**

12. **RES-9: Derived *relations* must be verified, not named (v1.3.3).** Y1 is RES-8 one level up. TR-8 stopped the Executor trusting a derived risk *value*; it kept trusting a derived *binding* — that a transmitted signature belonged to the executed proposal — because the signed object's preimage was not transmitted. TR-10 generalizes: **a transmitted identifier is a name for a binding, not evidence of one.** That this class recurred a *third* time (C2 → X1 → Y1), each in the machinery the previous fix introduced, is now strong evidence it is the architecture's structural failure mode. The mechanical RES-8/RES-9 field-and-relation audit (ACP-AUDIT-001 §1, proposed conformance suite 12) is the enforcement: it found Y1 where narrative review did not, and it should run against every future receipt field and every claimed binding before it ships.

13. **RES-10: An ambiguous normative grammar is an unenforced invariant (v1.3.4).** Z1 is the RES-8/RES-9 family in a third register. RES-8 concerned a *value* trusted rather than recomputed; RES-9 a *relation* named rather than verified; RES-10 concerns a *meaning* assumed rather than pinned. Through v1.3.3 the §8.3.1 production stated no precedence for `&&`/`||`, so "the" evaluated meaning of a mixed rule was not a property of the specification at all — it was a property of whichever parser happened to read it, and 4.9% of mixed expressions differed between two faithful readings. Note where it hid: Annex B proves eight theorems *about parsed expressions*, and the differential harness generates *ASTs*, so the entire assurance apparatus sat downstream of the ambiguity and could not see it. **The lesson generalizes: every proof has a boundary, and the defect will be found immediately outside it.** EL-1 closes Z1; the standing obligation is to ask, of each new proof, what it quantifies over and what feeds it.

**Resolved conflict (v1.3.9 → v1.3.10): CR-6 versus EO-2.** The hybrid floor and the 25 ms bound were jointly unsatisfiable on the measured floor-HIGH path. Resolved in v1.3.10 by differentiating the latency budget per risk class (EO-2, §8.4) — not by weakening either requirement. Hybrid suites remain mandatory on every path.

**Human approvals are classical (v1.3.30).** A passkey or hardware-key assertion is ES256 or Ed25519; nothing a person can hold signs post-quantum today. The quorum a human satisfies is therefore classical at the human leg, and the post-quantum guarantee of the decision rests on the receipt and the anchor that bind the assertion at the moment it was made (HM-6, CR-8). A deployment that needs a post-quantum human leg does not have one from this document and should say so.

**Open problems.** **Z1 migration (v1.3.4, tooling delivered v1.3.5):** EL-1 fixes the grammar going forward, but bundles authored against the ambiguous grammar may already encode the wrong meaning. Deployments **MUST** run `el1_migrate.py` (or an equivalent exhaustive checker) against every existing bundle before adopting EL-1; a reported grade change is a floor-honesty (A-7) event requiring RK-5 re-authoring with explicit parentheses and re-signing, not a routine deploy. **Whether §8.6a's `cap_escalated` marking creates an adversary-influenceable channel** — an attacker who can trip a fail-closed control may thereby influence which queue an item lands in, and the interaction between AQ-2 rate-limiting and floor-HIGH queue priority has not been analysed. Multi-step F-LOW intents (decomposition into Proposal sequences; per-step vs plan-level confirmation; rollback semantics). Confirmation fatigue at scale — DB-1's successor decays exactly like quorums do. Ambiguity handling when an utterance maps to multiple valid Proposals. Whether conversational state may condition F-LOW translation (context reuse widens the injection surface materially).

## Annex A — Fidelity Classes in Practice (Informative)

| Property | F-HIGH | F-LOW |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- |
| Instruction injection into the Proposal | Grammatically impossible | **Possible by construction** |
| Value conditioning of model output | Possible | Possible |
| Blast radius of a successful injection | — | Operator's capability envelope: cannot mint capabilities, cannot exceed policy, cannot reach the Executor without a receipt |
| Intent fidelity | Client-trusted (A-1) unless confirmation configured | **Confirmation mandatory** at effective tier ≥ T2 |
| Disposition | Standard | Stricter floor per FC-2 |
| Audit | Standard | Utterance hash **and** Proposal hash both recorded, enabling post-hoc divergence analysis without placing a model in the decision path |

Both classes share the enforcement core unchanged. The difference is *how much the Proposal is trusted to represent intent*, which policy expresses as a confirmation requirement and a disposition floor — not as a separate architecture.

## Annex B — Mechanized Proof of the Risk-Function Expression Language

**Per §1.1, this artifact has been executed: 62 verified, 0 errors, under the recorded toolchain. Mutation and differential controls accompany it.**

### B.1 Artifact

**File:** `ACP_RiskFunction_Proof.dfy` (inline below — this document is the authoritative copy)
**Size:** 772 lines
**SHA-256:** `152b97eed5928738e7aedc7d6c4c0392be851d3972bd22201132a3c1a01b1067`
**Tool:** Dafny `4.9.1+452c307284e1511e5c2d10b9615f4c9c15f010e2` with bundled Z3 4.12.1
**Command:** `dafny verify --function-syntax:4 ACP_RiskFunction_Proof.dfy`
**Result:** `62 verified, 0 errors` (per-assertion log: 62/62 Valid)

v1.2.0's artifact used Dafny-3 `predicate method` / `function method` syntax in 25 places while stating `--function-syntax:4`, under which those declarations do not parse — so its stated command could not have produced its claimed output. The code below uses v4 syntax throughout and is the byte-exact verified copy: re-running the stated command against this artifact reproduces the stated result.

### B.2 Methodology

Following AWS Cedar's verification-guided development pattern: model the language in Dafny, prove properties as lemmas with explicit bodies, validate the production evaluator separately by differential random testing.

Lemmas over finite enumerations (`RiskMax_*`, `TierMax_*`, and — per X4 — `FloorDominance` itself) are discharged by SMT case enumeration and carry comment-only bodies; this is legitimate and is stated here rather than claimed otherwise. v1.2.0 asserted "empty lemma bodies are not used for non-trivial properties" while `RiskMax_Monotone` — used in its primary proof — had a comment-only body.

### B.2a Mutation Testing (Negative Control)

A clean verification run is only meaningful if the theorems constrain the model. Six mutants, two purposes:

| ID | Mutation | Class | Result |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| M1 | `EffectiveTier`: max → min | Semantic | **KILLED** — 5 errors (`FloorDominance` family) |
| M2 | `RiskMax`: max → min | Semantic | **KILLED** — 6 errors |
| M3 | `FloorDominance`: remove `TierMax_GeqLeft` hint | Proof-minimality | **SURVIVED** — theorem verifies without the hint. Not a soundness defect; an honesty defect (FG-7 class). Dispositioned: hint deleted, body discloses SMT discharge. See X4. |
| M4 | `RiskLeq`: invert `(MEDIUM, LOW)` case | Semantic | **KILLED** — 1 error |
| M5 | Fold: condition target replaces `RiskMax(acc, target)` | Semantic | **KILLED** — 12 errors |
| M6 | `TierLeq`: invert `(T1, T0)` case | Semantic | **KILLED** — 1 error |

Semantic mutants: 5/5 killed — the clean run is load-bearing. The proof-minimality finding (M3) is the reason `FloorDominance` now carries an honestly empty body. One boundary observation for future revisions: the int64-bound theorem (`BreadthFitsInt64`) is one-sided and would not detect a `CidrMetric` definition error that *shrinks* the metric; the differential suite, which tests exact values, is the control that covers that direction.

### B.3 Theorems

| # | Theorem | Spec ref | Status |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1 | `Eval` totality | §8.3.1 | **Verified.** Termination by `decreases ExprSize(e)`; boolean codomain by return type. **No separate lemma** — v1.2.0's `EvalTerminates` had postcondition `exists b :: Eval(e,ctx)==b`, a tautology satisfied by any total boolean function. |
| 2 | `FloorDominance` | §8.3.2 TR-4 | **Verified.** The security-critical one. No raise value causes effective tier below floor. SMT-discharged over the 4×4 lattice (B.2a M3); killed by mutation M1. |
| 3 | `Monotonicity_Extension` | RK-3 | **Verified.** Appending a raise condition cannot decrease evaluated risk. Body completed in v1.3.2 (statement unchanged). |
| 4 | `BaseBound` | RK-3 | **Verified.** Evaluated risk ≥ base. |
| 5 | `RiskMax_Commutative` | RK-3 | **Verified.** Required for order-independence; absent in v1.2.0. |
| 6 | `Permutation_Invariance` | RK-3 | **Verified — and it required the manual effort §1.1 predicted.** Adjacent transposition invariance, lifted to a fold from index 0 by downward induction (`Transposition_Invariance_From`, added v1.3.2; statement unchanged). v1.2.0 asserted order-independence in prose and proved only associativity; v1.3.1 stated the right theorem with an insufficient body. |
| 7 | `ExpressionEvaluationDeterminism` | P-1, P-2 | **Verified.** Expression evaluator only. Full engine determinism is architectural (§8.1) + golden-file replay + differential suite. |
| 8 | `BreadthAccumulator_Exact` | AC-1a | **Verified.** Accumulator fold over CIDR metrics, arbitrary precision — no overflow precondition. `BreadthFitsInt64` (optional int64 bound) body completed in v1.3.2 via a `pow2` monotonicity family; statement unchanged. |

### B.4 Proof TCB

1. **Well-formedness** (`WellFormedExpr` under a typing environment) holds at evaluation time. Enforced by registry validation, bundle signature verification, and validator load-time checks.
2. **Context accuracy** — `EvalContext` reflects true state. Enforced by Context Store integrity, snapshot hashing, audit replay. Note: `FloorDominance` deliberately does *not* assume this for the raise component; that is its point.
3. **Arbitrary-precision integers** — Dafny's `int` is unbounded, matching AC-1a. Fixed-width production implementations must prove their own bounds.

### B.5 Scope Exclusions

Not covered: production implementation correctness (differential testing required); Context Store integrity; cryptographic properties; human attester behavior; full engine determinism; **the floor-setting process itself (A-7)** — the proof shows floors dominate raises, not that floors are correct.

### B.6 Conformance

A deployment claiming conformance **MUST** include this artifact (or an equivalent in Lean/Coq/Dafny) with its conformance report, verified cleanly with the stated toolchain. Grammar changes require re-verification of affected lemmas.

### B.7 Required Publication

1. The artifact with SHA-256 hash. **Published:** `sha256:152b97eed5928738e7aedc7d6c4c0392be851d3972bd22201132a3c1a01b1067`, 772 lines.
2. Toolchain metadata. **Published:** Dafny `4.9.1+452c307284e1511e5c2d10b9615f4c9c15f010e2`; Z3 4.12.1 (bundled default; 4.8.5 also ships with the release and was not used); command `dafny verify --function-syntax:4 ACP_RiskFunction_Proof.dfy`.
3. Complete `dafny verify` output showing 0 errors, 0 timeouts. **Published:** summary `62 verified, 0 errors`, exit 0; per-assertion log (`--log-format text`) showing 62/62 `Outcome: Valid`, shipped alongside this document as `verify_full_log.txt`.
4. Differential test plan for the production evaluator. **Published as an executed harness, not a plan** (`diff_harness.py`): the verified model is compiled to an executable oracle (`dafny translate py`); a generator produces well-formed §8.3.1 triples (random, plus hand-written boundary vectors covering absent fields, type mismatches, proposal-shadows-context resolution, `prefixlen` boundaries, and empty condition lists); every case is evaluated by three implementations — the **oracle**, an **iterative Engine-style evaluator**, and a **recursive Executor-style evaluator** modelling the TR-8 step-7 recomputation path — and any pairwise disagreement fails. Metamorphic checks additionally test Theorems 2/3/4/6 empirically against the Engine implementation (condition shuffling, extension, base bound, and the full 4×4 floor/raise lattice). **Result: 20,014 cases across two seeds, 0 disagreements, 0 metamorphic violations.** Deployments MUST substitute their own production binaries for the two model implementations and re-run.

**Methodological note.** The harness's first run failed with 103 disagreements — all traced to the harness's own FFI bridge (the Python backend erases Dafny wrapper datatypes such as `FieldRef`, so the bridge passed a wrapped value where compiled code expected the erased one). The oracle was right and the harness was wrong. This is disclosed because it is the differential method working as intended: representation mismatches between a verified model and the code that talks to it are precisely the defect class this suite exists to catch, and a deployment wiring its own binaries to the oracle should expect to hit the same class first.

## Annex C — Disposition of v1.2.0 Peer-Review Findings

| ID | Finding (v1.2.0) | Disposition in v1.3.0 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **C1** | Tier data in two mutually exclusive places; RK-5 protected a copy that did not feed evaluation | **Fixed by construction.** §8.3.2: floor in signed bundle, raise in Context Store, `effective = max`. One lattice, one integrity story. |
| **C2** | §10 claimed Context Store compromise does not violate INV-1-HIGH; tier suppression showed it does | **Fixed by construction.** TR-4/TR-5 + `FloorDominance` (Annex B, Theorem 2). "HIGH-impact" now defined as floor-only-HIGH. §10 row rewritten. |
| **C3** | §8.3.1 prohibited short-circuit evaluation; the artifact implemented it; differential testing could not detect a violation | **Claim retired.** §8.3.1 now requires result-order-independence, not evaluation-order constraint. Timing side channels explicitly out of scope (§4.2). Order-independence proved (Theorem 6). |
| **C4** | "Injection structurally impossible" vs "adversary controls prompt conditioning" | **Fixed.** §7.1 rewritten to distinguish instruction injection (eliminated for F-HIGH) from value conditioning (eliminated for neither). RES-6. |
| **C5** | Access/network ops assigned to Door A in §2.1 and Door B in §8.8 | **Fixed.** Door binary retired (§2.4). CP-4 states provider class is orthogonal to fidelity class. |
| **HA-1** | Approval-rendering layer trusted but absent from TCB; humans sign a hash they cannot read | **Named, partially mitigated.** A-8 + Attestation Presentation Service in TCB (§4.3). AT-3 requires floor-derived display and hash display. §12.6 device re-render as SHOULD. Residual disclosed (RES-5, §10 row). |
| **HA-2** | Bundle repository integrity and rollback-resistant "current bundle" unspecified | **Fixed.** §9.1.1 step 3 specifies isolation stronger than filesystem permissions; Bundle Repository in TCB; RAD-3 replaced by monotonic epoch. |
| **HA-3** | Nonce atomicity assumed target idempotency, false for in-scope non-idempotent HIGH actions | **Fixed by honest restatement.** §9.5: exactly-once only where the target supports it; at-most-once default otherwise; DS-4 forbids at-least-once for floor-HIGH non-idempotent. RES-3. |
| **HA-4** | INV-1-HIGH's preconditions omitted no-cross-operator-collusion | **Fixed.** A-9 added at the point the invariant is stated. |
| **TG-1** | Issuance→execution TOCTOU: Executor never re-queried Context; revoked authority exercisable ~2 min | **Fixed for floor-HIGH.** §9.3 step 9 adds execution-time capability recheck for floor-HIGH. MEDIUM residual disclosed. |
| **TG-2** | "Constraint narrowing" undefined; net-widening changes could take the expedited path | **Fixed.** SR-3 defines narrowing decidably over the bounded lattice; undecidable defaults to widening. |
| **TG-3** | RAD-3 permitted replay of a genuine but superseded permissive bundle | **Fixed.** RAD-3 replaced by durable monotonic `bundle_epoch` high-water mark. T-15. |
| **TG-4** | Output-weakness rationale mislocated for Door A | **Fixed** with C4. |
| **FG-1** | Order-independence asserted; no commutativity, no permutation theorem | **Fixed.** `RiskMax_Commutative` (Theorem 5) and `Permutation_Invariance` (Theorem 6) added. Conformance suite 4 tests it. |
| **FG-2** | `EvalTerminates` postcondition was a tautology | **Fixed.** Lemma removed; B.3 states termination is discharged by the `decreases` clause, which is where it always lived. |
| **FG-3** | Append-only monotonicity presented as "no rule combination lowers risk" | **Fixed by rewording + proving the gap.** Append (Theorem 3), base floor (Theorem 4), reorder (Theorem 6) are proved. Removal and base-lowering *can* lower risk — correctly, and are RK-5-governed procedurally. §14.4 reworded. |
| **FG-4** | CIDR boundedness disconnected from evaluator and accumulator; ≤10⁶ precondition unenforced | **Fixed.** AC-1a mandates arbitrary precision; `BreadthAccumulate` models the real fold; int64 bound retained as optional with explicit deployment obligation. |
| **FG-5** | `WellFormed*` weaker than §8.3.1 static constraints; no declared-field env, no CIDR typing | **Fixed.** `TypeEnv`, `WellTypedContext`, and CIDR-typing in `WellFormedComparison` added. |
| **FG-6** | Dafny-3 syntax vs `--function-syntax:4`; artifact could not parse under the stated command; line count wrong | **Fixed.** Artifact rewritten in v4 syntax. Line-count claim removed (artifact is inline; the document is authoritative). §1.1 discloses it remains unexecuted. |
| **FG-7** | B.2 claimed no empty bodies for non-trivial properties while load-bearing lemmas had comment-only bodies | **Fixed by honest restatement.** B.2 now states finite-enumeration lemmas are SMT-discharged with comment-only bodies, and says so plainly. |
| **RR-A** | Attestation amplification: one quorum → many HIGH executions under single-component compromise | **Fixed by construction.** `attestation_id` (AT-1) consumed in the ledger (CL-3); Executor step 7; reconciliation check (c). T-14. |
| **RR-B** | Induced fail-closed → ESCALATE flood → rubber-stamping, never discussed | **Named and mitigated.** §8.6a queue isolation; T-17; RES-2. Composition disclosed rather than hidden behind the availability exclusion. |
| **RR-C** | Untagged payload union; no envelope/payload `task_type` agreement check | **Fixed.** V-11 + discriminated union + `triple_matches_payload` validator in §6.3. |
| **RR-D** | Reference schemas omitted the V-7 handling they should exemplify | **Fixed.** `StrictBase` implements NFC normalization and bidi/zero-width rejection in §6.3. |
| **RR-E** | Door A gave no intent protection while Door B mandated DB-1 — strong door weaker than weak door | **Fixed by construction.** Confirmation unified as an attestation kind available to any adapter (AT-2), mandatory for F-LOW at T2+, configurable for F-HIGH. A-1 narrowed accordingly. |

**Summary.** Of 25 v1.2.0 findings: 15 fixed by construction (the defect becomes structurally impossible), 6 fixed by retiring or narrowing an overclaim, 4 named as explicit residuals with mitigations (RES-1 through RES-5). Three components entered the TCB. Net normative surface decreased.

### C.2 — Findings against v1.3.0

| ID | Finding (v1.3.0) | Disposition in v1.3.1 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **X1** | **Derived-risk forgery.** `risk_level_floor_only` and `fidelity` were transmitted in the receipt and consumed by the Executor to decide whether attestation was required. A single compromised KMS could assert `LOW` on a genuinely floor-T3 action with no attestations and execute it — a single-component break of INV-1-HIGH, and the same defect class as v1.2.0's C2 relocated from the Context Store to the receipt. | **Fixed by construction.** TR-8 requires Executor recomputation from the signed bundle and canonical Proposal; §9.3 steps 7/7a recompute and fail closed on disagreement; §9.2 marks the fields diagnostic; T-18 added; conformance suite 3 tests both forgeries; §10 KMS row corrected. Generalized as RES-8. |
| **X2** | AQ-2 `cap_escalated` marking may create an adversary-influenceable queue channel. | **Open.** Added to §15 open problems. Not yet analysed. |

**Note on review provenance.** The v1.3.0 review that confirmed the v1.2.0 fixes worked through Annex C in order and validated each disposition. That method can only surface defects already labelled; X1 sat in the new machinery and was not found by it. An independent adversarial review — by a party that did not author or revise this document — remains outstanding and is a conformance prerequisite (§14, suite 11).

### C.3 — Findings against v1.3.1, disposed in v1.3.2

| ID | Finding (v1.3.1) | Disposition in v1.3.2 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **X3** | **The published artifact did not verify.** The inline Annex B copy produced `45 verified, 6 errors` under its own stated command — four lemmas (`EvalRiskLevelAcc_ExtensionBound`, `Transposition_Invariance`, `Permutation_Invariance`, `BreadthFitsInt64`) had bodies insufficient for their statements. The same defect *shape* as v1.2.0's FG-6/FG-7 (artifact claims vs artifact behavior), caught this time because §1.1 had honestly labelled the artifact unexecuted. | **Fixed — body-only.** Seven helper lemmas added; all four failing bodies completed; signature-level diff shows additions only, every statement byte-identical. `62 verified, 0 errors` under Dafny 4.9.1 / Z3 4.12.1. Two independent verification passes converged on the same helper decomposition. Full record §1.1. |
| **X4** | **Decorative proof hint.** `FloorDominance`'s body called `TierMax_GeqLeft`, but mutation testing (B.2a M3) showed the theorem verifies without it — the body overstated manual proof work, the FG-7 defect class recurring in the revision that fixed FG-7. | **Fixed.** Hint deleted; the body now discloses SMT case-enumeration discharge per B.2's convention. Found by, and only findable by, the negative-control method — Annex-C-driven review would never have looked. |
| **X5** | **Version-string collision.** v1.3.1 was edited in place after publication (verification-status and Annex B changes under an unchanged version string), producing two documents labelled v1.3.1 with different content. A stale copy reaching a reviewer produced a false finding — the live demonstration of why SR-1 content-addresses schemas and PB-5 forbids epoch reuse. | **Fixed by rule.** This revision is v1.3.2 despite the small normative delta, and §1 now carries a release-integrity rule: revisions are immutable; any normative or Annex-B change, including verification status, increments the version. |

### C.4 — Findings against v1.3.2, disposed (PROPOSED) in v1.3.3

| ID | Finding (v1.3.2) | Disposition in v1.3.3 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Y1** | **Attestation misbinding — single-component INV-1-HIGH break.** The receipt carries attestation ids and signatures but not the signed Attestation Object, so §9.3 step 7b verifies signature validity but not binding to the executed proposal. A compromised KMS attaches a genuine quorum (raised for P₁) to a receipt for attacker-chosen floor-HIGH P₂; all Executor checks pass; P₂ executes. Third recurrence of the RES-8 class, in the attestation machinery X1's fix introduced. | **PROPOSED, UNCONFIRMED.** AT-8 (transmit full object), TR-10 (verify relations, not names), §9.3 step 7b rewritten to check `obj.proposal_hash == executed hash` and recompute the id. Mechanized in Annex D: `Y1_CurrentCheckAcceptsMisbinding` (defect real), `Y1_AttackBlocked` + `BindingSound` (fix sound), `Y1b_LedgerConsumesRealId` (second-order hole closed). Drafted by a party in the revision history; **suite 11 confirmation required before normative.** |
| **Y1b** | Second-order: even with binding checked, consuming the *transmitted* id lets a KMS substitute a garbage id and preserve the real id's freshness, reopening T-14. | **PROPOSED.** Step 7b(v): recompute `attestation_id` from the object; never read it from the receipt. Mechanized (`Y1b_LedgerConsumesRealId`). |
| **Y2** | Receipt validity *window length* is KMS-chosen; step 5 checked position, not size; L-14's 120 s lived only in the KMS-written value. Long-lived pre-positioned receipts. | **PROPOSED.** Step 5 adds `expires_at − issued_at ≤ 120 s`, Executor-enforced, fail-closed. |
| **Y3** | DS-3 re-drive issues a *new* attestation id — a new idempotency key — in exactly the lost-outcome case DS-1 exists to handle, enabling a doubled floor-HIGH non-idempotent action. | **Was OPEN in v1.3.3; FIXED in v1.3.4** by DS-6 — see C.5. |
| **Y4** | `operator` drives approver-distinctness and the step-9 recheck but is bound to no structure the Executor verifies. | **PROPOSED (folds into AT-8).** Add `operator` to the AT-1 object; Executor takes it from the verified object. |
| **Y5** | Minors: audit-chain genesis; dual JCS/CBOR canonicalization; reconciliation trust domain; nonce-claim liveness. | **CLOSED in v1.3.10.** Genesis specified (AU-8); canonicalization unified on CBOR with a validating decoder (AT-8a, implemented and tested); reconciliation trust domain stated (§11.3); nonce-claim liveness exercised under partition injection. |

**Note.** Y1 was found by mechanical RES-8 field classification (ACP-AUDIT-001), not narrative review — consistent with X1's lesson that the escaped defect lives in the newest machinery. The reviewing party is disqualified from suite 11; Y1 and its fix require independent confirmation.

### C.5 — Findings against v1.3.3, disposed in v1.3.4

Source: **ACP-REVIEW-002**, an independent adversarial review by a party with no authorship or revision history (the §14 suite 11 qualifying condition), which reproduced the Annex D artifact at its published hash, re-ran the published mutation control, and added three probes of its own.

| ID | Finding / result | Disposition in v1.3.4 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Y1** | **Independently CONFIRMED.** The attack was reconstructed from the v1.3.3 text without reliance on ACP-AUDIT-001's prose. Annex D reproduced: `4 verified, 0 errors` at `sha256:152b97ee…`-era artifact `binding.dfy`; the published mutation control (removing binding clause (ii)) reproduced exactly. | **NORMATIVE.** AT-8, TR-10, step 7b promoted from PROPOSED. |
| **Z0** | **Proof-strength defect in the fix's own model.** The published `Y1_AttackBlocked` confined the attacker to having observed a signature over *exactly one* message — unrealistic, since attesters sign many objects over their lifetime. | **FIXED.** Replaced by `Y1_AttackBlocked_Generalized` (attacker holds arbitrarily many observed signatures, none binding the executed proposal). Same axioms, same skeleton, verified. |
| **Z0b** | **Vacuity risk.** `Y1_AttackBlocked` is a negative result; it would be worthless if `Verify_v133` were unsatisfiable. Not previously checked. | **FIXED.** `HonestPathAccepted` added as a non-vacuity witness. Independent axiom-consistency smoke test (`assert false`) correctly **fails**, confirming `H_Injective` + `Signed` are not contradictory. |
| **Z0c** | **Clause independence unchecked.** The published mutation removed clause (ii) only; clause (i) was never shown load-bearing. | **FIXED.** Weakening (i) to "attester signed *something*" while retaining (ii) breaks `Y1_AttackBlocked` and `Y1b_LedgerConsumesRealId` (3 errors). Both clauses are independently necessary. |
| **Y2** | **CONFIRMED**; fix present and correct. L-14's enforcement point still read "Receipt" in §13 — the normative rule was right, the table was stale. | **NORMATIVE**; §13 L-14 corrected to "Executor (§9.3 step 5)". |
| **Y3** | **CONFIRMED**, and the most serious *open* item in v1.3.3: dispositioned OPEN with no draft text, on the only path that doubles a floor-HIGH non-idempotent action. | **FIXED — NEW, UNCONFIRMED.** DS-6 (action identity ≠ authorization identity), DS-1/DS-3 revised, L-25, T-20, suite 3 vectors. Mechanized: `Y3_RedriveDefeatsDedup` (defect), `Y3_Fixed_RedriveIsDedupped`, `Y3_Fixed_AuthorizationStillFresh`, `Y3_Fixed_DistinctActionsDistinctKeys`. **Drafted in this revision; requires independent confirmation before it is relied upon.** |
| **Y4** | **CONFIRMED**, and found **dispositioned in prose but not implemented**: C.4 said `operator` folds into AT-8, but neither §8.6's AT-8 text nor §9.3 step 7b listed it. The fix did not exist in the normative sections. | **FIXED.** `operator` added to AT-1; step 7b(iii-a) takes operator from the verified object; receipt body `operator` marked diagnostic; `Y4_OperatorTamperDetected` added. *Disclosed:* the v1.3.3 model had no theorem keying on `operator`, so dropping it from the preimage killed nothing — the mutation gap was found by mutating the reviewer's own model. |
| **Y5.2** | **RE-GRADED from informative minor to binding-path requirement.** AT-8 moved object hashing onto the binding path, where two canonicalizers means two ids for one object — a freshness defect in the mechanism Y1b closes. | **FIXED.** AT-8a: canonical CBOR for the Attestation Object, non-canonical encodings rejected. L-26 added. |
| **Z1** | **NEW — MEDIUM.** §8.3.1 states no precedence or associativity for `&&`/` | | `. Two evaluators written independently from the prose disagree on **493 of 10,000** generated cases (4.9%), minimal witness`action != 'deny' \|\| action == 'allow' && action == 'allow'`. Invisible to Annex B (quantifies over parsed`Expr`) and to B.7 item 4 (generates ASTs, not source text) — squarely the model↔production gap. | **FIXED.** EL-1 precedence and associativity rule; suite 8 parser vectors; `diff_prose.py` published as reference method; RES-10 added. **Residual CLOSED in v1.3.5** by `el1_migrate.py`: exhaustive per-bundle check over the truth-assignment space of each rule's atoms, reporting structural divergence, semantic divergence with a witness, and whether the resulting **risk grade** changes. Exit 1 = RK-5 review required before upgrade. |
| **Z2** | **NEW — LOW.** The normative `risk_functions` example used `∩` and `≠ ∅`, operators absent from the §8.3.1 grammar: the specification's own reference bundle was not admissible under its own expression language. | **FIXED.** Example rewritten to `port in SENSITIVE_PORTS`; RK-2a requires registry admission to reject inexpressible conditions and to expand named constants before hashing. |
| **Negative coverage** | Attacked and **not** broken: floor dominance under adversarial Context Store (TR-4); X1 re-attack (derived-risk forgery, closed by steps 7/7a); epoch rollback (RAD-3 high-water + CL-4 + 11.3(d)); nonce/attestation consumption for the *value* leg (CL-1/2/3). | Residual bounded rather than unexamined. |

**Not covered by ACP-REVIEW-002** (and therefore still unreviewed by a qualified party): §§6–7 ingress and output validation, §8.5 accumulators, §11 anchoring operations, and Annex B's proof bodies beyond the parser boundary. Suite 11 remains **partially** satisfied.

### C.6 — Findings against v1.3.4, disposed in v1.3.5

Source: an adversarial pass over v1.3.4's **own newest machinery** (DS-6, AT-8a), per the standing rule that the next escaped defect lives in whatever the last fix introduced. Both findings are in fixes drafted one revision earlier.

| ID | Finding (v1.3.4) | Disposition in v1.3.5 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Z3** | **Origin substitution — DS-6's own RES-8 defect.** DS-6b required verifying the claimed `origin_nonce` is "recorded as consumed in the ledger" — a **membership** test, not a **pinning** test. A compromised KMS names any other consumed nonce as origin; every check passes (fresh quorum, honest risk, valid AT-8 binding); the idempotency key moves; the target cannot dedup; the floor-HIGH action doubles. Classified **T** against no disclosed residual — a suite-12 conformance failure in the fix for Y3. Fourth recurrence of the class (C2 → X1 → Y1 → Z3). | **FIXED — NEW, UNCONFIRMED.** DS-6f: the ledger claims an immutable `proposal_hash → origin_nonce` binding atomically with the first receipt nonce; the Executor reads origin from the ledger; a receipt-carried value is diagnostic and must match or fail closed. CL-3 gains an origin-binding class with indefinite retention; L-27, T-22, suite 3 vector. Mechanized: `Z3_MembershipCheckDoesNotPinOrigin`, `Z3_Fixed_DistinctProposalsDistinctKeys`. |
| **Z4** | **Encoding split — AT-8a fixed the canonicalizer, not the schema.** Given any optional Attestation Object field, present-as-null and omitted are **each** canonical CBOR, hash to two ids, and claim two ledger slots: one attestation consumed twice. T-14 amplification reopens through the mechanism Y1b closed. Canonicalization rules cannot close it — the ambiguity is in the field set. | **FIXED — NEW, UNCONFIRMED.** AT-8b: closed schema, every AT-1 field REQUIRED, no defaults, no extension points; unknown or missing field ⇒ reject, never normalize. Object extension becomes a breaking `receipt_version` change. L-26 extended, T-23, suite 3 vector. Mechanized: `Z4_OptionalFieldYieldsTwoIds`. |
| **Z1 residual** | v1.3.4 specified no migration tooling for bundles authored under the ambiguous grammar. | **CLOSED.** `el1_migrate.py` — exhaustive over each rule's atom truth-assignment space; reports structural divergence, semantic divergence with witness, and whether the **risk grade** changes; exit 1 = RK-5 review required. Tested against an ambiguous bundle (correctly reports a MEDIUM→HIGH grade change) and its parenthesized form (correctly reports safe). |
| **Suite 12 artifact** | v1.3.4 made the classification table a conformance requirement without providing one. | **DELIVERED.** `ACP-CLASS-001` — 17 Executor inputs, 12 other-consumer inputs, 10 claimed relations, 0 undisclosed T, 2 undischarged relations (both A-7/A-8 human-boundary, both disclosed). |
| **Proof-body honesty** | Two lemmas drafted for the Z3 fix had **tautological postconditions** (`Key_pinned` does not take the claimed value, so "independent of the receipt" is true by typing, not by proof). | **REMOVED**, and the reason recorded in the artifact. This is the X4 class — a proof body asserting something its statement does not earn — caught this time before publication rather than by mutation testing after. |

**Pattern note (five revisions).** C2 → X1 → Y1 → Z3 are the same defect in four locations, and each was introduced by the fix for the previous one. Z4 is the same shape one layer down: a fix (AT-8a) that closed the stated hole and left an adjacent one open in the machinery it added. The operational conclusion is not that the fixes were poor — each was correct for what it addressed — but that **the review target must always be the newest text, and the newest text is always a fix.** §14 suite 12 and the standing instruction in the review brief both encode this; v1.3.5 is the first revision to apply it to its own previous revision as a matter of routine rather than in response to an external review.

**Summary of C.1–C.3.** All three v1.3.1→v1.3.2 findings are instances of the specification's own named defect classes (FG-6/FG-7, RES-8's "trust nothing derived", SR-1/PB-5) recurring against the document itself. The pattern across four revisions is consistent: the architecture's characteristic failure mode — asserting a property without a mechanism that enforces it — applies to the specification process, not only the pipeline. The mechanisms added in response (executed proof, mutation control, differential harness, release rule) are each an enforcement replacing an assertion.

## Annex D — Mechanized Binding, Delivery, Release and Signature-Composition Model

**Executed: `36 verified, 0 errors` under Dafny 4.9.1 / Z3 4.12.1.**

**Status.** Part I (Y1/Y1b/Y4 binding) is **NORMATIVE** following independent confirmation (Annex C.5). Parts II–V are **NEW and UNCONFIRMED**, drafted and mechanized by parties now in this document's revision history; §14 suite 11 confirmation is required before they are relied upon.

**File:** `binding_v1_3_8.dfy` — 651 lines, `sha256:0a50e24e974def28ffa93fd12bef02ddf2542c71d1106b79beb26683c7ea4005`
**Command:** `dafny verify --function-syntax:4 binding_v1_3_8.dfy`
**Result:** `Dafny program verifier finished with 36 verified, 0 errors`

**Scope by part.** I–III model abstract hashing and signatures: protocol reasoning, not cryptography (A-3 stands). IV models the release decision only — acknowledgement enters as an input, never as evidence that a human read anything. **V models signature *composition*, not the primitives**: "broken primitive" is `Forge`, an explicit forgery function producing an accepting signature for every message. Whether ML-DSA or Ed25519 resists anything is A-3; what is proven is that the conjunction survives losing either one.

**Two methodological notes, both learned from defects in this artifact.**

*Avoiding the tautology trap.* v1.3.4 published lemmas asserting a derived key was "independent of the receipt" when the claimed value was **not an argument** — true by typing, worthless as proof. Withdrawn (Annex C.6). Parts IV–V keep the claimed value as a **live parameter** whose body ignores it, so independence lemmas constrain the body. The control is empirical: Part IV mutant M1 makes the body read the receipt and five lemmas break.

*Skolemising the attacker.* `Broken` was first written `forall m :: exists sig :: Verifies(...)`. The nested existential gives the solver no trigger for the outer quantifier, so it could not be instantiated at a specific message and three proofs failed. It is now written with an explicit forgery function `Forge(p, k, m)`. This is a modelling improvement, not a weakening: `Forge` **is** the attacker's algorithm, and naming it is more honest than hiding it behind an existential.

| Part | Lemma | Establishes |
| ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| I–III | (13 lemmas, unchanged) | Y1/Y1b/Y4 binding, Y3/DS-6 delivery identity, Z3 origin pinning, Z4 encoding uniqueness. |
| IV | `RV3_TrustedModeAcceptsDowngrade` → `RV3_ModeIndependentOfReceipt` | The v1.3.6 defect and its closure: release mode identical for every receipt. |
| IV | `RV1_UnclassifiedNeverSilent` | An unclassified action can never release silently. |
| IV | `DR9_IrreversibleRequiresNonOperatorAck`, `DR9_OperatorCannotSelfRelease` | No receipt and no sampling draw releases an irreversible action without a non-operator acknowledgement. |
| IV | `DR11_GrindableDrawIsEvadable` → `DR11_DrawIndependentOfRequester` | A requester-derived draw is evadable; an Executor-supplied one is not. |
| **V** | `CR3_AND_SurvivesPQBreak` | **The theorem that justifies hybridation:** with the post-quantum primitive totally broken, no hybrid signature verifies while the classical one still binds. |
| **V** | `CR3_AND_SurvivesClassicalBreak` | Symmetric — the conjunction survives losing either member. |
| **V** | `CR3_OR_CollapsesOnSingleBreak` | Disjunctive composition falls to a single break. |
| **V** | `CR3_OR_IsWeakerThanEitherAlone` | Stronger and the operational point: under OR, breaking *either* primitive suffices — adding an algorithm **reduces** security. |
| **V** | `CR4_IssuerChosenAcceptsDowngrade` → `CR4_FloorRefusesDowngrade` | An issuer-chosen suite walks down to the weakest; a signed floor refuses. |
| IV–V | `NonVacuity_*` (4 lemmas) | Reversible-unsampled releases; irreversible-with-ack releases; sampling fires; honest hybrid signatures verify. Without these every negative above could hold because nothing ever verifies. |

**Mutation controls (all kill).**

| Mutant | Observed |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Parts I–III (binding clause, signature clause, DS-6 key, `operator`, DS-6f origin) | all kill, as v1.3.5 |
| IV-M1 release mode reads the receipt (revert RV-3) | **5 errors** |
| IV-M2 RV-1 default flipped to `REVERSIBLE` | **1 error** |
| IV-M3 DR-9 accepts the operator's own acknowledgement | **2 errors** |
| IV-M4 sampling draw derived from the task | **2 errors** |
| **V-M1 hybrid composition changed from AND to OR** | **2 errors** |
| **V-M2 suite floor check removed** | **1 error** |

**Axiom consistency.** `assert false` fails to verify against Parts I–V (1 error). Part V introduces one uninterpreted function (`Forge`) and no axioms.

**What is NOT proven.** That any human read a notification (DR-7/DR-9 residual, outside any model). That a deployment's notification path is genuinely independent of its presentation path (DR-2 is a property of code, checked by conformance suite 3). That ML-DSA, Ed25519 or SLH-DSA resist anything (A-3). That reversibility classifications or tier floors are honest (A-7, conceded unprovable).
