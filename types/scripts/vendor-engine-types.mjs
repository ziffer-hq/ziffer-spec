/**
 * ACP-214: materialise the engine's wire types into src/ from the pinned commit.
 *
 * WHY A BUILD-TIME COPY AND WHY IT IS NOT A FORK. The engine repository's rule
 * is "never fork — import them", and `sdk/python/build.sh` carries the argument
 * for the Python half at length. The same argument holds here: the COMMITTED
 * source of this package is the packaging only, the engine's generated types are
 * copied in VERBATIM at build time from a tree asserted to be at the pin, and
 * the copy is regenerated on every build so there is no divergent lineage to
 * drift. A committed copy would be a second definition of the wire format, and
 * two definitions of one object is the encoding-split defect at the source
 * level -- the thing `spec/schemas` being the only normative source exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * WHY THE PIN IS RECOMPUTED AND NOT READ. RES-8: a verifier never accepts a
 * derived security value from the party it is verifying. Applied here, the
 * party is the build, and the value is "which engine commit are these types".
 * There is exactly ONE authority for the pin in this repository -- the `rev` on
 * the engine git dependency in Cargo.toml, which is what tools/guard.sh reads
 * and calls "the pinned commit". Everything below is derived from that:
 *
 *   1. Cargo.toml's rev is read. Absent or malformed => halt.
 *   2. pnpm-lock.yaml's `resolution: {commit: ...}` for the @acp/types git
 *      entry must equal it. This is the RESOLVER'S OWN RECORD of the commit it
 *      actually fetched, not a second declaration of intent, so it is evidence
 *      about the bytes on disk rather than a claim beside them.
 *   3. Exactly one @acp/types directory may exist in pnpm's virtual store.
 *      Zero means `pnpm install` has not run; more than one means two pins are
 *      installed at once, and picking either would be this script choosing
 *      which engine the published package wraps. Both halt.
 *
 * What that chain does NOT prove is that the fetched tree's CONTENT is what the
 * engine has at that commit -- pnpm's integrity record covers the fetch, and no
 * hash of the engine's packages/acp-types is pinned here. Verifying that needs
 * the engine's signed manifest, which tools/guard.sh checks at the same commit
 * on every run. Stated rather than implied, because a chain is only as strong
 * as the link nobody wrote down.
